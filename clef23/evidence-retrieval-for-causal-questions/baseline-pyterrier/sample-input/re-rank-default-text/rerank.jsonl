Also, if there is a glare to your screen, you can \nreduce it by adjusting the monitor contrast. Remember to look away periodically.\n  When you spend any length of time when in front of a computer, you've \nprobably experienced some form of eye strain, vision headaches or maybe other \nstress inside your visual system.\n\nAnd you're not alone -\u00a0 upwards \nof 8 out of 10 computer users report some type of eye strain in the computer. \nThe problem can be so prevalent the right way to given a brand: Computer Vision \nPredicament (CVS).\n\nThe signs of Computer Eyesight Syndrome \ninclude: \n\n* eye balls hurting or over-tired \n * eye balls \nburning or scratching\n * dry, and also watery, eyes \n * two bottle \nvision\n * blurry eyesight (either on the computer or inside the distance) \n * the requirement of glasses for once \n * the fact that stronger \nprescriptions\n * head aches, neck, shoulder along with back tension \n * \nimproved sensitivity to light source\n\nUsing a computer does place a \nspecialized set of demands on your eyes. But it may not be inevitable for your \ncurrent eyes to hurt with the computer, or for you to experience eye strain \nalong at the computer, once you have learned to use your eyes correctly with \nthe task, and where to start at the earliest sign of anxiety or fatigue.\nSaving your eyesight along at the computer can be as simple as learning \nyour vision from a new way. Knowing visual ergonomics as well as simple keys \nthat will healthy computing should go quite a distance to alleviating the \nactual symptoms of Personal computer Vision Syndrome.\n\nHere are \npersonal trainer keys to responding to your eyes with the computer.\n\nFit your set up to you: \n\n* Set upward your computer \nto be able to look beyond this screen. If in any respect possible, don't be \ninside the corner, or encounter a wall.\n* Sit directly when in front of \ncomputer, not off to 1 side or other.\n* Sit 18-24 inches from the the screen\n * Sit high enough in order that your line associated with sight is grade \nwith or beyond the top of the screen\n * Maintain your wrists level together \nwith or below ones elbows. Never flex your wrists up when typing\n * Your \nknees ought to be below the level of your hips\n * Place you a on the \nfloorboards. Use a footrest should your feet don't accomplish the floor.\nONLY TWO. Look away with the screen regularly. \n\nEmphasizing an \nobject far, such as the lake cooler down the hall or a new tree outdoors, is a \nsimple stretching training for eye muscle mass. Quickly shift your own focus \nfrom near to far 3-4 periods.\n\nA brief explore the distance every 2-3 \nminutes prevents the particular build-up of vision stress and irritation and \nkeeps your own eyes healthy in addition to active.\n\nThese frequent \nmicro-breaks offer additional relief to a person's eyes than a hourly break. A \nbreak each and every hour - however long may - does not provide the many relief \nand rest your eyes need. Micro-breaks tend to be more effective and helpful.\n \nExtended staring in a computer screen inevitably creates fatigue, \npressure and eye difficulties. Failing to have short vision breaks is probably \nthe major factors resulting to eye strain along with eye problems regarding \ncomputer users.\n\nTiny vision break tip: Look up and look into the \nfurthest object within the distance. Be conscious of objects around you in your \nperiphery. Take a new deep breath. Relax while you exhale. Blink maybe once or \ntwice. Shift your vision back to the screen plus re-focus. (Three near-to-far \nadjustments per break tend to be recommended. This will need to take about 5 \nVARIOUS seconds. )\n\nHand mirror tip: If your personal machine is in a \nlarge part or if you work in a very small space, place a small mirror over your \nmonitor or against your desk. Use the mirror to allow your eyes a new distant \nview by looking with the mirror and focusing on objects that the simple truth \nis behind you.\n\nMinimize glare on the screen \n\n\nYou can identify a potential glare dilemma by turning for the lights in the \narea that you commonly would use - before turning on your hard disk. If you \nview any images or reflections for the (turned-off) screen, you've got a glare \nproblem.\n\nTo reduce or minimize glare, try by: \n\n* Moving the \nscreen to your better location, probably\n * Tilting the screen \n * \nRelocating objects that reveal onto the display\n * Covering your windows \nprogram to block sunlight\n * Turning away from or lowering offending lamps \n * Covering fluorescent lighting with egg-crate baffles \n * Turning \nyour computer so the display screen is perpendicular to be able to overhead \nfluorescent lights.\n\nIt may often be impossible to get rid of glare \naltogether, then you might consider employing an anti-glare display screen.\n Use warm and friendly lighting. \n\nBright \nfluorescent lights are a poor choice. Dimmer signals are better. Employ a desk \nlamp with regard to reading and undertaking other close do the job at your \ndesk, but make sure aging reflect on the screen.\n\nMost problems are \ngenerally caused by the amount of the light (not by fluorescence itself). \nProbably, turn off some other fluorescent fixture plus light your desk with a \n100-watt bulb.\n\nStanding lamps this direct light on the ceiling provide \nthe best indirect light. If you find no dimmer on the market, a 3-way light \nfixture is recommended to help you to set the light along at the most \ncomfortable stage.\n\nYou also must light any original copy that you'll \nbe working from. A desk area rug with an adjustable neck works well. Just make \nsure that light doesn't distract an individual or spill against your screen.\nVery difficult copy tip: Friends and family, you want your copy around the \nsame vertical plane as the screen. Working side in order to side is more \neffective to looking from the screen down in your copy and then copy again. \nAlternate moving your written material that you simply work from into the left \nand right in the screen daily. The eye movements instructed to shift backwards \nand forwards from left in order to right and by screen to copy lessen visual \nstress along with enhance your graphic skills.\n\nBlink more \nregularly. \n\nComputer rooms are generally notoriously dry, \nthis also may be one reason why your eyes hurt in the computer. Blinking is \nyour body's natural knack of lubricating your sight and preventing waterless \neyes. Normally the vision blinks 10-12 times a secong.\n\nMost people \nnever blink regularly, specifically when concentrating intently, and also when \nunder stress. They keep their eyes open up - fixed -- and blinking minimizes. \nDecreased blinking normally causes redness, burning and itching from the eyes, \nparticularly for individuals who use contact improved lenses.\n\nBlinking \nlubricates along with cleanses the face, keeping them succulent for clear \nprospect and comfort. Flashing also helps loosen up the facial muscle mass and \nforehead, countering the tendency to furrow someone's brow and develop tension.\n \nHydrate simply by drinking enough normal water. If absolutely \nrequired, use a herbal eye drop. Similasan or PrimaVu include the recommended \nbrands.\n\nFlashing tip: Move just your eyelids : not your temple, face \nor cheeks - if you blink. Make sure a person close your eyes entirely without \neffort which both the upper and lower lids touch gently. Blink lightly once \nevery 3 to 5 seconds. Or, take 10-20 blinks in this manner just as your eyes \nbegin to feel dry, worn out or itchy.\n\nThese five tips ought to be \nenough to retain you from sense eye strain with the computer. It may be very \nsimple to never let your eyes hurt along at the computer.\n\nBut \nsometimes these pointers are not ample. The causes of the blurred vision and \nvisual stress could go deeper. Be sure you have your eyes checked no less than \nonce a season, and make sure you are using the proper prescription for personal \ncomputer use - it isn't really always similar to your regular herpes simplex \nvirus.

Nature, a prestigious journal in the field of Bioscience, has \ntaken the unprecedented step of issuing a warning to readers to suspend \njudgment on one of its printed research papers. The author and principal \nexperimenter, Professor Jacques Benveniste of the French Medical Research \nCouncil, has been subjected to scorn, ridicule, and critical investigation of \nhis experimental procedures because the results he printed supported \nhomoeopathic medicine. Paul Callinan, one of Australia's few homoeopathic \nresearchers, looks at the past and present of this contentious medicine.\n The rising profile of homoeopathy has produced something of a dilemma in \nthe world of medicine: does it work or doesn't it? The decision bites deep: if \nhomoeopathic medicine is nothing but fraud, quackery, and placebo, as many of \nits opponents would maintain, then a large number of competently trained \nhomoeopaths and doctors, together with countless thousands of dedicated lay \npractitioners have been led up the medical garden path. Their millions of \npatients, including many heads of state and prominent members of several of \nEurope's royal families, have fallen victim to the most successful medical hoax \never perpetrated. On the other hand, if homoeopathic medicine is effective, \nthen for the first time in more than a hundred years the Western world is on \nthe verge of developing an entirely new system of medicine. The medicines are \nnon-toxic and easily manufactured; they are also very cheap.\n  \n\nDuring the 170 years of its existence, homoeopathy has been the centre of \ncontinual and often bitter medical controversy. It has been particularly \nopposed by orthodox medicine, otherwise known as allopathy. But recently, both \nresearch and patient support has grown at a rapid pace. Yet rather than being \nhailed as a possible new medical breakthrough to give better health for all, it \nhas been ridiculed, ignored and systematically suppressed.\nClearly, something is wrong. The problem is that homoeopathic medicines can \nbe diluted to such extremes that it can be shown physically, chemically, and \nmathematically that there is nothing in the final dose but water. Obviously \nthen, the objection goes, any medicinal effect is nothing but placebo, and the \nhomoeopaths are both frauds and charlatans.\nYet the origins of homoeopathic medicine are both honorable and orthodox. \nIt was developed in Germany by the research of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann \n(1755-1834), who as well as being an experienced orthodox physician was also a \ncompetent chemist, a good mineralogist and botanist, and an able translator of \neight different languages. His research stemmed from dissatisfaction with the \nstandard medical practices of his time: routine bleedings, heroic purgings with \ncathartics, and administration of large doses of crude drugs. While translating \nCullen's Materia Medica into German, he was struck by a hitherto unexplored \nmedical observation, first mentioned by Hippocrates. Cullen had proposed that \nthe notable success of cinchona (an extract of quinine bark) in the treatment \nof swamp fever was due to its value as a stomach tonic. Hahnemann disagreed, \nand in his research on the question decided to take a course of the cinchona \nextract himself. To his surprise, he developed a set of symptoms remarkably \nsimilar to those of the swamp fever it was used to treat. All the symptoms \ndisappeared when he stopped taking it. Further administration to himself and \nhis family always produced the same symptoms, varying only in degree.\nThis was a strange phenomenon, uncited in the medical literature of the \nday. A remedy which was effective in a particular disease would produce a \nsimilar set of symptoms in a healthy person, when given in sufficient doses. In \nsearching for precedents for this effect, he established that the first mention \nmade of it was in the writings of Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.), regarded by the \northodoxy as the father of modern medicine. Hippocrates had said that likes can \nbe cured by likes: that vomiting may be stopped by being made to vomit, and any \nillness caused by one means can be treated successfully by a similar means.\nThe Law of Similars\nFrom this Hahnemann produced the first axiom of homoeopathy: Similia \nSimilibus Curentur - Let Likes be Cured by Likes, otherwise known as the Law of \nSimilars - and so began his life's work. By 1821 he had produced two major \nworks: The Organon of Rational Medicine, embodying the principles of the \nhomoeopathic approach to medicine, and his Materia Medica Pura, covering the \neffects of sixty four medicines. \nThis approach to medicine represents a dramatic move away from the \nestablished method. The allopathic approach was of establishing the existence \nof a particular disease, clarifying its symptoms, and then testing the \neffectiveness of various medicines on it, by the use of opposites. An illness \naccompanied by fever and diarrhea, for example, would call for the combined use \nof medicines which would be anti-febrile and others which would normally \nconstipate, and so in a crude way, a total balance would be found by using a \nnumber of appropriate medicines together. The homoeopaths tried the opposite \napproach: first test a substance for medicinal use, they said, by giving it to \nhealthy volunteers, and carefully noting the symptoms it produces. This is \nknown as a proving. Once the symptom picture has been fully developed over a \nnumber of human trials, then it can be assessed for usefulness against diseases \nwith a similar set of symptoms. A substance which produces a bizarre set of \nsymptoms such as bright red orifices and blue-green discharges, for example, \nwill have little use in homoeopathic clinical practice because symptoms of this \ntype are rarely met. However a substance which produces a runny nose, watery \nred eyes and repeated sneezing would be of great value in the treatment of hay \nfever. The common onion produces just those symptoms (as countless cooks can \nguarantee), and by use of the above trial system the onion has now achieved an \nestablished place in homoeopathic therapeutics. In essence, allopathic medicine \nembodies the law of opposites, homoeopathic medicine the law of similars.\nPotentisation\nAt first the homoeopathic approach to medicine seems contradictory. Surely \nexperience would tell us that exposing hay fever sufferers to large doses of \nonion would just add insult to injury, and make them worse rather than better. \nThe homoeopaths would agree, but with two provisos.\nFirst the symptoms must match closely before onion will have a therapeutic \neffect; this is embodied in their Law of the Single Remedy, which states that \nthe most effective result will come from the most similar remedy given in \nsingle doses. Then after the initial aggravation of symptoms dies down, the hay \nfever will be noticeably better.\nSecond, if the initial doses of onion are sufficiently diluted, there will \nbe very little aggravation at all before improvement sets in. In fact, the \nhomoeopaths see dilution to infinitesimal degrees as a necessary part of the \npreparation of their medicines. It is embodied in the other important axiom for \ntreatment; the Law of the Minimum Dose. This states that the most effective \ndose for a disorder is the minimum amount necessary to produce a response. Give \none dose only of the diluted substance, the homoeopaths say, and then wait for \na favorable reaction. Having produced the desired improvement, give a second \ndose only when improvement stops.\nIt is this dilution of homoeopathic medicines which has been the greatest \nobstacle to their more universal acceptance. The process is known as \npotentisation, and involves a sequence of progressive dilution and a rhythmic \nshaking, termed succussion. In the normal case, 1 part of the source substance \nis added to 9 parts of water and shaken rhythmically. This is known as a 1x \n(decimal) dilution, or 1 part in 10. One part of this is then taken and added \nto another 9 parts of water, and again succussed, to give a 2x dilution, or 1 \npart in 100. Similarly, a 3x dilution is 1 part in 1000. These dilutions, also \nknown as potencies, can be repeated an large number of times.\n Dilutions are also made on a centesimal scale, or 1 part in 100, yielding \n1c, 2c, and so on. It needs only a little mental arithmetic to appreciate that \na dilution procedure of this type (either decimal or centesimal) rapidly \ndisperses the original substance. Figure 1 gives a summary of the potencies, \nand their corresponding dilutions.\n  \n\u00a0\n  Summary of the homoeopathic potencies\n\nshowing concentrations of the source drug. \n\nThe Avogadro Limit\nIn practice, a convenient classification of the dilutions is usually used: \n\nLow potencies: 1x to 30x, or 1c to 15c.\nMedium potencies: 30c to 200c.\nHigh potencies: Above 200c.\nHence the low potencies have been diluted least, and may still contain \nsignificant amounts of the source drug. But at 12c or 24x what is known as the \nAvogadro limit is reached, and at this concentration it is unlikely for even a \nsingle molecule of the original drug to be still present in one liter of the \npreparation. Yet the Avogadro limit occurs in the low potency range, and the \nhomoeopaths maintain that, contrary to expectations, the power of the medicine \nincreases as the potency increases. So there is very little doubt that many \npatients treated with high potencies receive nothing but water.\n The Homoeopathic Dilutions\nWhile the toxicity of such medicines is obviously very low, their efficacy \nhas been seriously questioned, as dilutions above 12c can be dismissed on \npharmacological grounds as completely inert. Yet potencies in the medium to \nhigh dilution range are the normal working area of homoeopathy, and many \nstriking cures have been claimed. The first and obvious response is to claim \nthat the action in successful cases is purely placebo, and the medicine is \nuseful only in the suggestible and the gullible. Not so, maintain the \nhomoeopaths, who claim cures on infants, animals, unconscious patients, those \nwith infectious diseases, and those with deep seated chronic disorders. In \naddition, the clinical trials are impressive. So the medical plot thickens.\n  \n\nClinical Trials\nThe early homoeopaths were all trained allopaths, and once having been \nconvinced of the effectiveness of homoeopathic medicines, felt no need to prove \nanything to anybody. After all, they had the training to use whatever medicine \nthey considered appropriate for their patients. It was also expedient to make \nas little noise as possible about their use of a medicine which was already \nregarded as suspect within their own ranks. In any case, most of their research \ntime was spent on provings, in order to expand the number of known and useful \nmedicines, and very little on clinical trials.\nAs a result, it took an event of considerable magnitude to bring the \nmedicine out into the open, and the European cholera epidemic of 1832, two \nyears before Hahnemann's death, was just such an occasion. By the accounts of \nall observers, the homoeopaths had a far higher recovery rate than the \nallopaths, and it is recounted that in Paris, the price of the homoeopathic \nmedicine for cholera increased 100-fold. In Russia (where it is said the \nepidemic originated), the report from the Consul General showed that of the \n1,270 cases treated homeopathically, 1,162 recovered, and only 108 died, giving \na mortality rate of less than 10 percent. By contrast, the mortality rate from \nallopathic treatment was 60 to 70 percent.\nFollowing the homoeopathic success in the epidemic, medical interest in \nhomoeopathy increased at a rapid rate, and by the time of the next European \ncholera epidemic in 1854, the London Homoeopathic Hospital was already \nestablished. Its facilities were turned over entirely to the treatment of \ncholera victims, and the results were impressive. The homoeopathic death rate \nwas 16.4 percent, compared to the allopathic death rate of 51.8 percent. \nSimilar successful figures were reluctantly reported by a number of other \ncountries. Detailed returns for Britain had to be made by all hospitals and \npractitioners as to treatment and results in cholera, and the totals submitted \nby the British Medical Council in their Blue Book of Statistics. However, the \nfigures from the Homoeopathic Hospital were deliberately omitted, and were only \nproduced after considerable protest. The official reason for the omission was \nthat inclusion of the homoeopathic figures \"would give an unjustifiable \nsanction to an empirical practice, alike opposed to the maintenance of truth \nand the progress of science.\"\nThis prejudiced and bigoted reaction to the success of homoeopathic \nmedicine is typical of the problem which has plagued the advance of science for \nmany centuries. Orthodox medicine, in particular, is well known for its poor \ntrack record in meeting innovative change and research breakthroughs with the \nproper degree of scientific detachment and quiet encouragement. Even within \ntheir own ranks, some of the greatest of innovators, such as Lister, Jenner, \nand Harvey, suffered ridicule and professional ostracism over discoveries which \nlater became mainstays of medical practice. In reaction to homoeopathic \nsuccesses, the modern orthodox call has been for more clinical trials. Give us \ncontrolled trials, many allopaths have said, and if successful, we will accept \nthe medicine.\nSince that time, a number of clinical trials have been run, but many of \nthem with poor controls. Some of the better run trials are summarized here \nbriefly. Those looking for a more complete list could do no better than the \nexcellent review of Scofield.\nMustard Gas\nThe best controlled of the early clinical trials was conducted jointly in \nLondon and Glasgow during the second world war, to find a method of prevention \nand treatment of mustard gas burns. Mustard gas in the 30c potency, given as a \npreventative, reduced the incidence of deep and medium burns significantly. The \nremedies Rhus tox and Kali bich also gave statistically significant results in \ntreatment.\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nMore recent trials were conducted in 1978 at the Glasgow Homoeopathic \nHospital, now emerging as a stronghold of homoeopathic research. Gibson and \nco-workers conducted a double-blind comparison of a range of homoeopathic \nremedies (matched against the individual symptom pictures), and compared the \nresponses to those of salicylates and placebo in the treatment of rheumatoid \narthritis. They showed that the patients who received homoeopathic remedies \nresponded statistically better than those who received salicylates; moreover 42 \npercent of the homoeopathic group were able to discontinue all other treatment \nduring the year.\nObjections to the method of trial led to a more rigidly designed trial in \n1980, where patients were given either a homoeopathic medicine or placebo, but \nwere allowed to continue with their orthodox anti-inflammatory drugs. The \nhomoeopathic group showed significant improvement as judged by a number of \ntests, as compared to the patients who received placebo. It was noted that \nhomoeopathy was a safer and no less effective alternative to present day second \nline drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\nHay Fever - The Crack Widens\nOne of the most recent clinical trials, and certainly the most tightly \ncontrolled to date, was conducted in 1986 at the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital \nby Dr David Taylor Reilly, an allopath by training. The claim that homoeopathic \nmedicines are placebo was tested in a randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial. The effects of a homoeopathic preparation of mixed \ngrass pollens (30c potency, no molecules of the original pollen remaining) was \ncompared with those of placebo in a total of 144 patients with active hay \nfever. The homeopathically treated patients showed a statistically significant \nreduction in symptoms as assessed by both patient and physician. No evidence \nemerged to support the idea that placebo action explains the clinical response \nto homoeopathic remedies.\nThe publishing of this latter paper in the Lancet, arguably the most \nprestigious medical journal in the world, indicated the depth of penetration of \nhomoeopathic medicine into the allopathic world. The controversy it produced \nindicated the degree of crystallization of the collective allopathic brain. \nHere at last was proof positive in the much upheld double-blind trial, yet the \ncollective reaction was less than positive. Although some of the more \nfar-sighted of the correspondents suggested the possibility that a new \nchemistry and a new physics had been born, the reliance on pharmacology in the \nallopathic way of thinking showed its dominance. Reactions to drugs are caused \nby molecules of drug substance interacting with various body components, the \nthinking goes, and if there are no drug molecules in a medicine then there is \nno reaction aside from placebo effects. The experiment was simply testing one \nplacebo against another. The fact that statistical significance was obtained \nfor one of the `placebos' was apparently deemed of no consequence, and \nindicates that the issue may not be a scientific issue at all, but more an \neconomic and emotional one.\nPharmacological Support\nLogically, one of the first areas to investigate for support (or the lack \nof it) in homoeopathy is the area of pharmacology, or drug action. And contrary \nto expectations, some surprising support is appearing.\nAsk a pharmacologist about the biological effect of very low concentrations \nof common substances on living organisms and the answer will be that there is \ntypically very little or zero response. Ask for some theoretical backup, and in \nshort order you will find yourself confronted by one of the pharmacological \ntools of trade, the Dose - Response Curve. In brief, the curve illustrates one \nof the rules of thumb in drug use: that an increased dose of a drug will give \nan increased effect, while a lowered dose of a drug will give a reduced effect, \nand a very low dose will give no effect at all.\n A glance at the curve in Figure 3 will show that the pharmacologically \nrecommended dose of a drug lies in the area of the ED50, the dose which \nproduces 50% of the total or maximal effect. The homoeopathic area of interest, \non the other hand, lies at the very start of the curve, in the area of the \nso-called threshold dose. \n  \n\nThe area of the threshold dose is usually avoided in standard \npharmacological drug testing, for two reasons. The first is that the threshold \ndose lies some distance from the area of the ED50, so investigating this area \nfor drug reaction is basically a waste of time. But the other reason is far \nmore interesting. The threshold dose is an area where paradoxical and \ncontradictory results are obtained, not easily explained in conventional terms. \nAgain, the easy answer is to simply avoid it in experimentation. But the bottom \nline is that for many years the pharmacologists have known of the strange \nresults obtained in the threshold dose area, but have simply chosen to ignore \nthem. In doing so, they had unwittingly withdrawn orthodox support for an \nentirely different field of medicine. It is interesting that one of the \nvery earliest laws of pharmacology, known as the Arndt - Schulz Law, had \nalready expressed the homoeopathic effect. Formulated by Arndt in 1888, and \nrestated by Hueppe a few years later, the law set the groundwork for what \nshould have been a side-by-side development of allopathic and homoeopathic \nmedicine in the following century. It states: For every substance, small doses \nstimulate, moderate doses inhibit, large doses kill.\u00a0 \n\nAllopathic medicine, with its emphasis on moderate drug doses, works in the \ninhibitory part of the scale. The result is seen in the typically inhibitory \nmedicines produced: antihistamines, antibiotics, antacids, cough suppressants \nand so on, laying the basis for the so-called `suppressant' effect of drugs.\nHomoeopathic medicine, on the other hand, begins at the stimulatory end of \nthe curve, and moves to the left, into the smaller and smaller dose range. Its \nemphasis is on the stimulation of the body's natural balancing mechanisms, as \nseen in its philosophy of the natural regeneration of the body through \nrebuilding of vitality, a concept also in close agreement with naturopathic \nthought.\nThe pioneering work of Boyd bound the worlds of homoeopathy and \nArndt-Schulz together in the early 1940s with a series of tightly controlled \nexperiments, and set the stage for work much later on as to how homoeopathic \nmedicine may work. Boyd worked with the enzyme malt diastase, which was already \nknown to be inhibited by crude doses of the salt mercuric chloride, and \nmeasured its speed in the hydrolysis of starch. He also used a number of \nhomeopathically prepared dilutions of mercuric chloride, including a batch at \n61x, where there was no likelihood of any of the original salt remaining - it \nwas pure water. He also worked with distilled water as a control. He showed \nthat crude doses of mercuric chloride inhibited diastase activity, as was \nalready well known, and that distilled water had no effect. But he also showed, \nwith statistically significant results, that mercuric chloride 61x accelerated \ndiastase activity.\nNow this experiment had a number of ramifications, besides supporting the \nArndt-Schulz Law. If there was no mercuric chloride in the 61x potency, the it \nshould have reacted the same as distilled water. If, on the other hand, there \nwas a contamination of mercuric chloride somehow in the test doses, then the \nactivity of the enzyme should have decreased. Instead it did neither, but \nincreased, from the laboratory point of view, homoeopathic medicines not only \nhad been showed to work according to the Arndt-Schulz Law, but had been shown \nto affect enzyme action.\n  \n\nHormesis: The New Breakthrough\nLook up the Arndt-Schulz Law in a modern textbook of pharmacology, and you \nwill be lucky if you find it mentioned, let alone discussed. It died out of the \ntextbooks as the allopathic interest moved further into the inhibitory part of \nthe Arndt-Schulz curve, and as the pharmacological Dose - Response curve \navoided the area of the threshold dose. It appeared that, for all its promising \norigins, theoretical support for homoeopathy had died a natural death.\nRecently, however, further support for homoeopathic medicine has come from \na most unlikely direction: the field of toxicology, or the action of poisons. \nBeginning in 1960, data began to accumulate that poisonous substances were \nhaving two effects on living organisms(5). At high doses they inhibited \nmetabolism and ultimately caused death, as was well known. But at low doses \nthey exerted a stimulating effect, a response totally unexpected and not \nexplainable by current medical science. Recently the trickle turned to a \ntorrent, as toxicologists turned to examine the new phenomenon of hormesis, the \nname given to the stimulatory effect of low levels of usually poisonous \nsubstances. The Arndt-Schulz Law had not died: it had simply resurfaced with a \nnew name.\nThe research results are incomplete, but the trend is inescapable. Evidence \nfrom experiments, both human and animal, shows hormesis as an effect occurring \nin all biological domains tested, with growing research support. It \ndemonstrates that all substances (including pesticides and carcinogens) which \nshow an inhibitory effect at high concentrations, have a stimulatory effect at \nlow concentrations.\nTypical Concentration-Response Curves Developed in Hormesis Research\n  \n\nThe alpha curve is the most expected pattern, and is assumed to describe \nthe actions of drugs in humans as the concentration moves from low \nconcentrations to progressively more inhibitory ones. This curve is a tentative \none, and is assigned to those drugs which have not yet been fully tested for a \nstimulatory response.\nThe beta curve was the most frequently observed pattern, and accounted for \nthe human reactions to the bulk of the drugs tested. It shows a typical curve \nas predicted by the Arndt-Schulz Law, but (understandably) was not tested in \ntoxic and lethal dose ranges. \nThe two other curves the gamma and delta forms, were recorded where data \nwas available for biological response at lower dose ranges. However data points \nfor these ranges are generally less available, so the validity of these curves \nis unknown until further data is available.\nHomoeopathic research has consistently produced results showing the basic \ncurve structure of hormesis and the Arndt-Schulz Law. But the research goes \nfurther: as the drug substance is progressively diluted, the biological \nreaction alternates between stimulation and inhibition, as given by the \nhormesis gamma and delta curves. This periodic behavior is called rhythmicity \nby the homoeopaths, and represents one of the several great unexplained \nphenomena in homoeopathic action. But one factor is established: as the \ndilutions become extreme and the concentration of the source drug approaches \nzero, the biological reaction will also fade out unless the diluted solution is \nsuccussed in accord with traditional homoeopathic practice.\n  \n\n  A typical rhythmicity curve of the homoeopathic remedy Prunus \nSpinosa\nThe implications of hormesis are enormous and deserve a story of their own, \nbut a few points here may give future directions.\n: Pesticides which are toxic to pests at high concentrations can cause a \nproliferation of their growth at lower concentrations, such as can occur in \nrainwater run-off and collecting river systems. The ecological value of their \nuse will tumble.\n: Any substance which causes cancer will likewise be shown to be \nanti-cancer in its action at a lower dose range.\n: The present tactic of various health departments in this country of \ngiving a herb in high doses to experimental animals (and then banning it in all \ndose ranges when tumors form) will become counterproductive. Any herb which \ncauses cancer in high doses will be shown to protective against the same cancer \nin low dose ranges, suitable for human intake.\nHow Does Homoeopathy Work?\nCentral to the issue of medical acceptance of homoeopathy is the \nclarification of its mechanism of action. In particular, is there a model which \nadequately explains its clinical effectiveness and the successes of the trials?\n\nIn the development of a workable model, the research thinking has gone \nsomething like this: Given that the medicine is effective even when it can be \nshown that there is no likelihood of any molecules left in a particular dose \n(due to dilution), then the effect of the dose must lie with the water \nmolecules themselves, since that is all that is left. Water itself can be \nassumed to have no effect in this case, since the dose is small, and the effect \nwould always be the same. The answer must lie within the water molecules, and \nthe only real possibility is in the type of energy that the molecule has stored.\n\nEnergy storage within molecules in biological systems lies within the realm \nof biophysics rather than biochemistry. Biophysics is a new field, having \nbecome established only within the last twenty years or so. It is not yet \nincluded in medical curricula in universities to any great extent, and is only \nnow beginning to make its mark in the biological sciences. Small wonder, \ntherefore, that the established medical world knows little of its existence, or \nthe promise it holds in explaining the action of the medicines of energy, such \nas homoeopathy, acupuncture, psychic and spirit healing, and radionics.\nEnergy Storage\nMolecules such as water can store energy in four different ways - kinetic, \nspin, vibration and electronic excitation. Some storage modes can store more \nenergy than others, and we will start at the lowest, least energetic mode, \nwhich is kinetic energy, or energy of motion. A molecule stores kinetic energy \nby virtue of its speed. It is this storage in gases and liquids which causes \npressure (such as air pressure) by the continual collision of the molecules \nwith surfaces like our skin, and also causes the bulk of chemical reactions to \noccur. At room temperature, the energy which these molecules contain is low, \ncompared with other states. It is unsuited to homoeopathic medicine since the \nenergy is constantly altered by collision, and so any energy stored is degraded.\n\n  \n\nSpin and Microwave Cooking\nSpin energy is found in gases and liquids, but not in solids, where the \nstronger attractions between molecules prevents rotation. It is also not found \nin water until about 420C, a factor of considerable importance to living \norganisms, composed as they are of up to 90 percent water, with humans being \nabout 40 percent. Heating up water to about 42 degrees causes sufficient \ndisruption of the molecular attraction between molecules to allow spin to \noccur, and that's precisely the temperature at which humans start to die. Life \nprocesses in general seem to keep a safe distance from the temperature band of \n42 to 45 degrees.\nSpin energy in molecules corresponds to microwave radiation, which is one \nreason why this radiation is lethal. It is also an indication of the potential \npower of energy storage in this mode - strong enough to cook food. But it is \nunsuited to homoeopathic medicine, since at room temperature, the spin storage \nstate in water has not become active.\nElectronic Excitation\nAt the top end of the scale is electronic excitation, which is the stuff \npowering lasers, of great strength and intensity. Excite the electrons circling \nthe component molecules up into higher orbits and energy is stored. Drop them \ndown together, and a pulse of light is given out. It may be of sufficient \nstrength and power to burn a hole through a razor blade, cut tissue in surgery, \nor stop an army tank - it depends on what molecules are used, and how strongly \nthe electrons are excited. It is not suitable for homoeopathic medicine, \nbecause the excited electrons are unstable, and will decay in a matter of \nfractions of a second.\nVibratory Storage \nStanding midway between the cooking power of microwave and the destructive \npower of lasers stands vibratory energy. Although it has an accepted place in \nphysics as a means of storing energy, it has had a chequered career in medical \nscience because of its association with trance mediums, psychic phenomena and \nextrasensory perception. Vibratory energy can be found in molecules throughout \nall three states of matter - solid, liquid and gas. It is responsible for \nphenomena such as the expansion of metals when heated, and the transfer of heat \nby conduction. Vibratory motion of a molecule increases when the molecule \nabsorbs energy, and can re-radiate it at a later date, usually in the infrared \npart of the spectrum, where heat is also found.\nIt is in the storage of vibratory energy in water molecules during the \nsuccussion process that homoeopathic medicine places many of its hopes for a \nscientific explanation of its action. It is proposed that during the collision \nprocess, vibratory energy is exchanged between the source drug and the water, \nand that the water is left with a vibratory imprint of the drug. Further \nsuccussion makes the imprint deeper, which explains why the medicines are \nregarded as acting more strongly as the dilution increases. Furthermore it is \nnot just energy which is being stored, it is proposed, but information, \ndiffering from one remedy to another depending on the source substance used, \nwith every substance leaving a different vibratory signature in the water \nmolecule. In this way homoeopathic medicine is seen as carrying information \ninto the body when it is taken in dose form, perhaps as biological instructions.\n\nIf water molecules were dissociated from each other at room temperature, \nany vibratory energy stored would quickly degrade. But at 250C, about 70% of \nwater molecules are incorporated into a stable hexagonal lattice structure, \ncapable of storing a considerable amount of vibratory energy before it breaks \nup. But storage of vibratory energy causes structural changes, because any \nmolecule which absorb energy will always change its shape. So a convenient way \nof telling if this particular model was correct was to examine homoeopathic \nwater for structural changes.\nA number of workers over the years have shown that both high and low \npotency homoeopathic medicines show structural changes in the water they \ncontain. It was additionally shown that in order for the structural changes to \noccur, two things must happen. First, there must be a source drug to begin \nwith; that is, you can't make a homoeopathic medicine from water alone. \nSecondly, you must succuss the remedy as it is diluted stepwise, in the \nrhythmic shaking manner used by the homoeopaths for many years. Only when these \ntwo processes are included will structural changes show. \n\nCertainly one of the most visually impressive experiments to test the \npossibility of structural changes was carried out recently, involving ice \ncrystals. Ice crystal structures are very good mirrors of the energy status of \ntheir component water molecules. It is why, for instance, you will never find \ntwo identical snowflake patterns, for each is formed under slightly different \nconditions. In the experiment, different potencies of the homoeopathic remedy \nPulsatilla were frozen at -100C, and photographed under polarized light to show \nany changes in the ice crystal structure. The results are strikingly beautiful, \nand the changes in crystal size as the potencies increase indicate increased \nenergy storage in vibratory modes.\nIce Crystal Photos Here\nBenveniste - Champion or Charlatan?\nIn one of the stranger episodes in the recorded history of scientific \npublishing, the prestigious British research journal Nature recently published \nexperimental results which the editors say they consider utterly impossible. \nThe typically indigestible title of the paper is \"Human Basophil \nDegranulation Triggered by Very Dilute Antiserum Against IgE, and the \nconclusions it proposes have been similarly indigestible to the medical \ncommunity. The main players in the experiment were a special type of white \nblood cell known as a basophil and an antibody, IgE. When basophils are \nnormally exposed to this antibody, their chemistry and internal structure \nchange, in a way that is easily checked by staining techniques. But what \nBenveniste and his colleagues found was that the changes occurred even when the \nantibody was used up to the 120x potency, a dilution at which it is virtually \nimpossible for even one molecule of the antibody to remain. The results also \nshowed the familiar rhythmic changes in basophil reactions as the potencies \nincreased, a factor still unexplained, even by homoeopaths. The deputy editor \nof Nature remarked that two centuries of observation and rational thinking \nabout biology will have to be abandoned if the results stand, because they \ncannot be explained by existing physical laws.\nThe 13 member international research team headed by Professor Benveniste \nconducted their experiments after being challenged by two eminent French \nhomoeopaths to disprove homoeopathy once and for all, by conducting a \nsensitive, tightly controlled experiment in an accredited research centre. The \ncentre chosen was at the University of South Paris, where Professor Benveniste \nis a Research Director. \"That was how it all started\", he said. \n\"They challenged us to prove them wrong, and we couldn't.\"\nThe furor surrounding this experiment has produced some unique reactions \nwithin the scientific community, and highlights an important question: how \nshould the scientific establishment deal with anomalous findings which \nchallenge the very roots of established thought? Nature journal had its own \nanswer: it sent a fraud squad comprising one of its editors, a professional \nmagician, and an investigator of scientific frauds from the USA to Benveniste's \nlaboratories. Over a period of a week they criticized shortcomings in \nexperimental design, studied the laboratory records, and interrogated the \nresearchers. Finally, they failed to replicate the results in a double-blind \ntrial, and declared the experiments \"a delusion.\" Benveniste, not \nunexpectedly, considered the investigation a witch hunt and an outrage. \"I \nwelcome any explanation for our findings\" he said, \"but not this kind \nof crap.\"\nThe homoeopaths of the world, together with interested onlookers, can be \nassured that the matter will not rest there. Further interesting reading on the \nbizarre reactions to homoeopathic experiments on the part of the scientific and \nmedical establishments will surface. Benveniste will undoubtedly be back, with \na more tightly controlled experiment which will probably decide, once and for \nall, the future of homoeopathy.\nReferences:\n1.

The Nuclear Mechanism\n 5. Mechanism of the Effect On The \nOrganism\n 6. The Future\n1. Introduction\nHahnemann and Homoeopathy \nSince its inception in 1796 by the German physician and experimental \npharmacologist Samuel Hahnemann, homoeopathy has survived but is still a \nmedical fringe discipline.\nHahnemann published his Organon in 1810, one year before Avogadro presented \nhis hypothesis that there are 6.02 x1023 molecules of a substance in 1 gram \nmolecular weight. The solutions used in homoeopathy are both diluted and \nsuccussed, and in this case means that a substance has been diluted through a \nserial process in such a way that the dilution of the original drug may \napproach Avogadro's number and even exceed it. Since a one molar solution \nstepwise diluted to the 12c potency is unlikely to contain even one molecule of \nsolute, and a basic tenet of homoeopathy is that solutions which have no active \ndrug molecules can still have effects on the human organism, homoeopathy has \nmet with substantial opposition from pharmacology.\nEven 200 years after Hahnemann's discoveries, homoeopathy still lacks a \ntheoretical foundation. Experimental studies on the nature of homoeopathic \nsolutions have reported many changes: there are reported alterations in the \ninfrared spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times, surface \ntension, dielectric constant, and a handful of other parameters. Biological \nstudies have shown marked changes in enzyme speed, cardiac rate, muscle \ncontraction and plant growth, to name but a few. Clinical trials are showing \nconsistently better results as experimental design is improved. But experiments \nhave been plagued by lack of reproducibility, and data could not be \nconsistently interpreted. A number of models had been proposed to explain \nhomoeopathic action, the most popular being the water memory model, but all \nmodels have been fairly speculative.\nThe French Team\nEnter Rolland Conte and team from the field of economics. After many years \nof research in economics and macroeconomic forecasting, the French researchers \nConte, Berliocchi, and Andras introduced in their book Nouvelle Economie \nTheorique a new mathematical theory known as Ether theory, and a new \nstatistical tool known as Contonian statistics.\nAt the beginning of 1993 the team of Conte, Berliocchi, Lasne and Vernot \napplied these same mathematical techniques to the field of homoeopathy. They \nformulated a mathematical representation of high dilution effects using quantum \nfield theory. In their book, Theory Of High Dilutions, they provide the results \nof their measurements and the rationale for its interpretation. The theory is \ninnovative, high-tech, and breaks much new ground. The model they present may \nalso explain, after so long, how homoeopathic medicine works.\nRolland Conte is a PhD in applied physics, with extensive experience in \neconomics and macroeconomic forecasting, and the inspirational force behind \nContonian statistics. Henri Berliocchi is a mathematician with a brilliant \nhistory, who provided the ether theory and the physico-mathematical model. Yves \nLasne is a doctor of medicine, doctor of science, who provided the detection \ntechnology and research methodology, based on measurement of nuclear magnetic \nresonance and beta radiation. Gabriel Vernot is an engineer and computer \nscientist working in aerospace applications, and who provided the dedicated \nAAPDI software. \nAs early as 1985 Lasne had repeated earlier work showing evidence of \nchanges in the infrared spectrum of homoeopathic solutions, and had \ndemonstrated significant variation of T2 relaxation times in nuclear magnetic \nresonance studies over a range of centesimal dilutions. Lasne also reported \nevidence of radiation coming from the test samples. Contonian statistical \nanalysis of NMR results and \u00e1-radiation began on a range of raw high \ndilution data. The analysis is run on dedicated Ecosem software called AAPDI, \nwhich stands for Analyse Activite Pharmacologique Dilutions Infinitesimales.\nAnalysis of infrared and NMR data produced a number, known as a Contonian \nfrequency, even from data which at first glance was not reproducible or \nconsistent with other experimentation. The Contonian frequency for a remedy is \nreproducible, given stable external variables. Every remedy has a unique \nContonian frequency, offering a likely measuring tool by which quality control \nand formulation efficiency can be evaluated. In the history of homoeopathic \nmanufacture, we have never had such a measuring tool; and as they say in \nscience, if you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.\nIn essence, the French team have proposed a model for homoeopathic action \nbased on classical quantum theory, a new mathematical theory, and a statistical \ntool for linking theory and experimental data. They have produced experimental \nverification of their model based on NMR work, and on beta-radiation \nmeasurements. The use of Contonian statistics has led to quantifiable results.\n\n2. The Contonian Model\nMathematical and physical frameworks are presented which use classical \nquantum theory and quantum field theory. They require a strong background in \nphysics and higher mathematics to appreciate their insights. The researchers \nreport that their physico-mathematical model proposed is in accord with \nexperimental results, and answers questions raised by considerations of high \ndilution and water memory.\nThe Mathematical Framework\nThe mathematical framework provides a theory for interpreting high dilution \nphenomena using quantum mathematics. It involves set theory and probabilistic \nmodeling, and uses mathematical operators such as lagrangians in a way that \nwould make your head swim. It involves:\n. The use of real numbers as defined within the set theory known as the \nZermelo-Frenkel theory.\n. In handling classical quantum theory, another axiom, known as the choice \naxiom, is used in addition to the Zermelo-Frenkel theory.\n. An additional axiom, known as Solovay's axiom, is used.\n. A model of real numbers, known as Levy's model, is used jointly with \nSolovay's axiom and consideration of the Brownian motion of water molecules to \nestablish the water memory model.\n. A general mechanism for interpreting data, known as semiotic mechanics, \nhas been introduced. This mechanism had been previously validated by \nBerliocchi, one of the authors, within his theory of ethers.\nThe Physical Model\nWithin the physical model, a number of events have been proposed and \nmeasured.\n White holes\nThe disappearance of drug molecules during dilution leads to a dislocation \nin the solvent known as a singularity. This singularity has been termed a white \nhole. It can be thought of a small but highly energized area of space.\nThe remanent wave\nThe appearance of a singularity induces a wave which has been termed a \nremanent wave. It can be thought of as a set of ripples in a pond when a stone \nis dropped in. A remanent wave is always created when a particle disappears and \nleaves a white hole, and the number of remanent waves is proportional to the \nnumber of particles lost. When one continues the release at the same place and \nin a regularly spaced way, the waves produced are in phase and the amplitude \nincreases. When no further stones are released, the ripples disappear within a \ncertain time, and the wave energy is slowly released in the water as heat. This \ncan be measured using standard equipment such as infrared absorption \nspectrophotometers.\n Nuclear transformations\nThe appearance of a white hole and a remanent wave induces nuclear \nreactions in the high dilution medium. The creation of tritium, an isotope of \nhydrogen in water, results in the subsequent decay of a tritium neutron into an \nelectron, a proton and a particle known as an anti-graviton which has no mass \nand no charge. Beta radiation can be detected. There are changes in NMR and in \nthe infrared. Beta radiation is associated with electrons, while infrared is \ncommonly known as heat. The energy of a remanent wave of a diluted-succussed \nsolutions is around 1 KeV. For a high dilution of HNO3, measurement of the beta \nenergy spectrum gives a frequency of 2.4 x 1017 Hz. This is a very high \nfrequency, the wavelength range lying in a band from 1.25 and 10 nanometres. By \ncomparison, the period of vibration of the helicoil nucleic acid chain of DNA \nis equal to 3.4 nanometres. This means that the DNA can act as a \ntransmitter-receiver antenna. In essence, nuclear transformations in the test \ntube at room temperature are being proposed, although the efficiency is low. \nThis was reported many years ago by Kerveran, another Frenchman, who wrote on \nbiological transmutation within living organisms.\n Hyperprotons\nAbove the Avogadro limit, no more white holes are produced, but there is a \ncontinued stimulation from succussion termed hyperproton expansion. \nHyperprotons are seen as the missing link between chemistry and biochemistry. \nThey are considered as particles that phase in and out of space-time. This is \nthe basis of the relativistic and quantum theory of fields, the current theory \nin physics covering matter-energy interactions. The theory of hyperprotons uses \nthe so-called second quantisation theory of Dirac for a free material particle \nin space-time: Dirac in 1933 proposed the emergence of a real electron from a \nsea of virtual electrons, sometimes called the second quantisation. Hyperproton \nexpansion produces irradiation effects on surrounding matter, and reorganises \nthe solvent structure. Such a field has been measured, and is calculated by \nrenormalisation through the integral of Feynman. Hydrogen and oxygen \nlagrangians on data measured at 300 Mhz in NMR studies indicate a \nre-organization of the water structure. This provides evidence for the \nexistence of a new quantum state, whose nature has not been fully elucidated.\n\n Potencies exhibit phase changes\nNMR studies show that the impregnation of lactose granules with succussed \npreparations produces an effective transfer but induces a phase displacement in \nthe primary signal, the extent of phase displacement depending on the nature of \nthe source drug and the potency. The general form of the phase displacement is \na sinusoid. For sulphur dilutions around 300c, the displacement is 1800 out of \nphase. By contrast, histamine shows a very small phase displacement. Solutions \nwhich exhibit a 1800 phase displacement have an opposite effect on test systems \n(pea root length, frog leg metamorphosis) compared with solutions 00 out of \nphase. Hence stimulation of a test system at one dilution can be altered to \ninhibition at another dilution.\n Effects not due to contaminants\nAn experimental approach was developed which demonstrated that the effects \nobtained were not due to the presence of contaminants in the diluent. The use \nof the contonian frequency indicates that the specific activity of high \ndilutions are reproducible within experimental error as long as external \nvariables are controlled.\nThe Axioms Of The Contonian Model\nAs a result of these findings, two axioms have been formulated:\nAxiom 1\nThe dilution-succussion process induces an effect which can be directly \nmeasured by physical and biological experiments.\nAxiom 2\nAn informational message will be produced only if at least one substance \nexists in the diluent at the start of the process.\n3. Impact of Environmental Factors On The Remanent Wave\nContonian frequency calculations indicate that the specific activity of \nhigh dilutions is reproducible at any time provided that external variables are \ncontrolled, such as:\n. Temperature. \n. Light.\n. The amount of energy introduced by the succussion process.\n. Moon phases. \n. Gravitational forces. \n. Other external influences such as ultrasound.\nSome of these findings come as no surprise, as they appear to validate some \nissues known to the profession by experience.\n. The sensitivity of homoeopathic medicines to light and temperature is \nwell accepted amongst the homoeopathic profession.\n. More surprising is the sensitivity to factors such as the phases of the \nmoon and changes in geomagnetic flux. However it has been said by many \nhomoeopaths that some remedies are better given at particular phases of the \nmoon.\n. It has also been suggested that homoeopathic medicines do not travel well \nbecause it involves moving though the magnetic field of the earth.\n. It is also worth mentioning that the sensitivity of manufacture of high \ndilutions to changes in geomagnetic flux and gravitational flux was predicted \nin the physical model by the appearance of an anti-graviton during beta \nemission.\nThe need for a consistent medicine to be manufactured in a machine where \nthe succussion speed and stroke length are optimized and consistent has led to \nthe patented development of a succussion device.\n4. The Nuclear Transformation Mechanism\nAs previously proposed, white hole creation leads to an irradiation of \ndiluted-succussed solutions due to a neutron type field induced by the remanent \nwave. This irradiation will create, on the one hand hydrogen isotopes deuterium \n(1 proton and 1 neutron) and tritium (1 proton and 2 neutrons), or on the other \nhand oxygen O17. The efficiency of this nuclear reaction is known to be low. \nWith regard to tritium, the neutron splits and releases 1 proton and 1 \n\u00e1- electron and an anti-graviton.\nAutoradiography techniques have shown \u00e1-radiation emitted from \ngranules impregnated with a preparation of potassium iodide, with no radiation \nbeing detected from controls. For dilutions up to 12c, beta radiation is \nexpected to predominate, seeing that the level of succussion is low.\nIn dilutions higher than Avogadro, no more white holes are created. Neutron \ndisintegration releases energy into a medium which already has a high proton \ncontent. The protons are then transformed into hyperprotons, which are \nconsidered as virtual particles that can phase in and out of space-time. They \nmay also appear within the space-time singularities as nuclear protons. These \nhyperprotons will stabilize one part of the diluent structure (a local effect) \nthat will then be able to influence the non structured part of the diluent.\n5. Mechanism of the Effect On The Organism\nA quantum model called Theory of Universal Wave Function has been proposed, \nto describe the effect of high dilutions on living organisms. They have \nproposed that intoxication of an organism by a toxic solution such as CCl4 \ninduces a deviation from a state of health as indicated by a vector, and a \nphase displacement. Treatment of the organism with a high dilution of the \ncorrectly chosen remedy with a counteracting phase displacement restores the \norganism to its original vector and a healthy state.\nTo illustrate this proposal, the effect of dilutions of thyroxin upon the \nmetamorphosis of tadpoles of the grass frog were studied. When added to the \naqueous medium, diluted and succussed thyroxin can inhibit or accelerate larval \ndevelopment of the forelegs, depending on the dilution. On the basis of phase \ndisplacements, it is suggested that when the thyroxin preparation is in phase \nwith the larval organism, the thyroxin acts as a booster for the transformation \nfrom the two legged to the four legged stage. When the thyroxin preparation is \nnot in phase with the larval development, it inhibits metamorphosis. It was \nalso noted that different effects were produced in the organism, depending on \nwhether the solutions were succussed or not.\nThe specificity of diluted-succussed solutions is remarkable, even if an \nenzyme system specific of a given diluted-succussed solution has not been \nfound. Interaction between two remanent waves induces a generalized and fast \naction on the organism. When such an interaction does not occur, the solution \nsimply has no impact on the organism. The specificity of the diluted-succussed \nsolution takes place within phase space.\nSubstantial interest has been centered on the enzyme peroxidase, which is \nseen as decoding structures introduced by the dilution-succussion process and \ninducing a proton flow within the organism. This has substantial promise in the \nunderstanding of meridian flow structure within the organism, as well as \nshedding light on the findings of Boyd, nearly half a century ago, who showed \nthat homoeopathic potencies altered the speed of the enzyme diastase.\nThe processes of elimination and heart beat within the human body are \nproposed to fulfill all the requirements of white hole emergence. Remanent \nwaves are seen as pervading the whole organism in a normal state of health. \nFood denial or fasting for a short period is considered to improve the \nobservation of the remanent wave. As a result, a person may be considered as \nhaving a remanent wave profile, a situation offering great promise in \ntherapeutics.\n6.

Nature, a prestigious journal in the field of \nBioscience, has taken the unprecedented step of issuing a warning to readers to \nsuspend judgment on one of its printed research papers. The author and \nprincipal experimenter, Professor Jacques Benveniste of the French Medical \nResearch Council, has been subjected to scorn, ridicule, and critical \ninvestigation of his experimental procedures because the results he printed \nsupported homoeopathic medicine. Paul Callinan, one of Australia's few \nhomoeopathic researchers, looks at the past and present of this contentious \nmedicine.\nThe rising profile of homoeopathy has produced something of a dilemma in \nthe world of medicine: does it work or doesn't it? The decision bites deep: if \nhomoeopathic medicine is nothing but fraud, quackery, and placebo, as many of \nits opponents would maintain, then a large number of competently trained \nhomoeopaths and doctors, together with countless thousands of dedicated lay \npractitioners have been led up the medical garden path. Their millions of \npatients, including many heads of state and prominent members of several of \nEurope's royal families, have fallen victim to the most successful medical hoax \never perpetrated. On the other hand, if homoeopathic medicine is effective, \nthen for the first time in more than a hundred years the Western world is on \nthe verge of developing an entirely new system of medicine. The medicines are \nnon-toxic and easily manufactured; they are also very cheap.\n \nDuring the 170 years of its existence, homoeopathy has been the centre of \ncontinual and often bitter medical controversy. It has been particularly \nopposed by orthodox medicine, otherwise known as allopathy. But recently, both \nresearch and patient support has grown at a rapid pace. Yet rather than being \nhailed as a possible new medical breakthrough to give better health for all, it \nhas been ridiculed, ignored and systematically suppressed.\nClearly, something is wrong. The problem is that homoeopathic medicines can \nbe diluted to such extremes that it can be shown physically, chemically, and \nmathematically that there is nothing in the final dose but water. Obviously \nthen, the objection goes, any medicinal effect is nothing but placebo, and the \nhomoeopaths are both frauds and charlatans.\nYet the origins of homoeopathic medicine are both honorable and orthodox. \nIt was developed in Germany by the research of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann \n(1755-1834), who as well as being an experienced orthodox physician was also a \ncompetent chemist, a good mineralogist and botanist, and an able translator of \neight different languages. His research stemmed from dissatisfaction with the \nstandard medical practices of his time: routine bleedings, heroic purgings with \ncathartics, and administration of large doses of crude drugs. While translating \nCullen's Materia Medica into German, he was struck by a hitherto unexplored \nmedical observation, first mentioned by Hippocrates. Cullen had proposed that \nthe notable success of cinchona (an extract of quinine bark) in the treatment \nof swamp fever was due to its value as a stomach tonic. Hahnemann disagreed, \nand in his research on the question decided to take a course of the cinchona \nextract himself. To his surprise, he developed a set of symptoms remarkably \nsimilar to those of the swamp fever it was used to treat. All the symptoms \ndisappeared when he stopped taking it. Further administration to himself and \nhis family always produced the same symptoms, varying only in degree.\nThis was a strange phenomenon, uncited in the medical literature of the \nday. A remedy which was effective in a particular disease would produce a \nsimilar set of symptoms in a healthy person, when given in sufficient doses. In \nsearching for precedents for this effect, he established that the first mention \nmade of it was in the writings of Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.), regarded by the \northodoxy as the father of modern medicine. Hippocrates had said that likes can \nbe cured by likes: that vomiting may be stopped by being made to vomit, and any \nillness caused by one means can be treated successfully by a similar means.\nThe Law of Similars\nFrom this Hahnemann produced the first axiom of homoeopathy: Similia \nSimilibus Curentur - Let Likes be Cured by Likes, otherwise known as the Law of \nSimilars - and so began his life's work. By 1821 he had produced two major \nworks: The Organon of Rational Medicine, embodying the principles of the \nhomoeopathic approach to medicine, and his Materia Medica Pura, covering the \neffects of sixty four medicines. \nThis approach to medicine represents a dramatic move away from the \nestablished method. The allopathic approach was of establishing the existence \nof a particular disease, clarifying its symptoms, and then testing the \neffectiveness of various medicines on it, by the use of opposites. An illness \naccompanied by fever and diarrhea, for example, would call for the combined use \nof medicines which would be anti-febrile and others which would normally \nconstipate, and so in a crude way, a total balance would be found by using a \nnumber of appropriate medicines together. The homoeopaths tried the opposite \napproach: first test a substance for medicinal use, they said, by giving it to \nhealthy volunteers, and carefully noting the symptoms it produces. This is \nknown as a proving. Once the symptom picture has been fully developed over a \nnumber of human trials, then it can be assessed for usefulness against diseases \nwith a similar set of symptoms. A substance which produces a bizarre set of \nsymptoms such as bright red orifices and blue-green discharges, for example, \nwill have little use in homoeopathic clinical practice because symptoms of this \ntype are rarely met. However a substance which produces a runny nose, watery \nred eyes and repeated sneezing would be of great value in the treatment of hay \nfever. The common onion produces just those symptoms (as countless cooks can \nguarantee), and by use of the above trial system the onion has now achieved an \nestablished place in homoeopathic therapeutics. In essence, allopathic medicine \nembodies the law of opposites, homoeopathic medicine the law of similars.\nPotentisation\nAt first the homoeopathic approach to medicine seems contradictory. Surely \nexperience would tell us that exposing hay fever sufferers to large doses of \nonion would just add insult to injury, and make them worse rather than better. \nThe homoeopaths would agree, but with two provisos.\nFirst the symptoms must match closely before onion will have a therapeutic \neffect; this is embodied in their Law of the Single Remedy, which states that \nthe most effective result will come from the most similar remedy given in \nsingle doses. Then after the initial aggravation of symptoms dies down, the hay \nfever will be noticeably better.\nSecond, if the initial doses of onion are sufficiently diluted, there will \nbe very little aggravation at all before improvement sets in. In fact, the \nhomoeopaths see dilution to infinitesimal degrees as a necessary part of the \npreparation of their medicines. It is embodied in the other important axiom for \ntreatment; the Law of the Minimum Dose. This states that the most effective \ndose for a disorder is the minimum amount necessary to produce a response. Give \none dose only of the diluted substance, the homoeopaths say, and then wait for \na favorable reaction. Having produced the desired improvement, give a second \ndose only when improvement stops.\nIt is this dilution of homoeopathic medicines which has been the greatest \nobstacle to their more universal acceptance. The process is known as \npotentisation, and involves a sequence of progressive dilution and a rhythmic \nshaking, termed succussion. In the normal case, 1 part of the source substance \nis added to 9 parts of water and shaken rhythmically. This is known as a 1x \n(decimal) dilution, or 1 part in 10. One part of this is then taken and added \nto another 9 parts of water, and again succussed, to give a 2x dilution, or 1 \npart in 100. Similarly, a 3x dilution is 1 part in 1000. These dilutions, also \nknown as potencies, can be repeated an large number of times.\n Dilutions are also made on a centesimal scale, or 1 part in 100, yielding \n1c, 2c, and so on. It needs only a little mental arithmetic to appreciate that \na dilution procedure of this type (either decimal or centesimal) rapidly \ndisperses the original substance. Figure 1 gives a summary of the potencies, \nand their corresponding dilutions.\n  \n\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n Summary of the homoeopathic potencies\n\nshowing concentrations of the source drug. \n\nThe Avogadro Limit\nIn practice, a convenient classification of the dilutions is usually used: \n\nLow potencies: 1x to 30x, or 1c to 15c.\nMedium potencies: 30c to 200c.\nHigh potencies: Above 200c.\nHence the low potencies have been diluted least, and may still contain \nsignificant amounts of the source drug. But at 12c or 24x what is known as the \nAvogadro limit is reached, and at this concentration it is unlikely for even a \nsingle molecule of the original drug to be still present in one liter of the \npreparation. Yet the Avogadro limit occurs in the low potency range, and the \nhomoeopaths maintain that, contrary to expectations, the power of the medicine \nincreases as the potency increases. So there is very little doubt that many \npatients treated with high potencies receive nothing but water.\n The Homoeopathic Dilutions\nWhile the toxicity of such medicines is obviously very low, their efficacy \nhas been seriously questioned, as dilutions above 12c can be dismissed on \npharmacological grounds as completely inert. Yet potencies in the medium to \nhigh dilution range are the normal working area of homoeopathy, and many \nstriking cures have been claimed. The first and obvious response is to claim \nthat the action in successful cases is purely placebo, and the medicine is \nuseful only in the suggestible and the gullible. Not so, maintain the \nhomoeopaths, who claim cures on infants, animals, unconscious patients, those \nwith infectious diseases, and those with deep seated chronic disorders. In \naddition, the clinical trials are impressive. So the medical plot thickens.\n  \n\n\u00a0 \n\nClinical Trials\nThe early homoeopaths were all trained allopaths, and once having been \nconvinced of the effectiveness of homoeopathic medicines, felt no need to prove \nanything to anybody. After all, they had the training to use whatever medicine \nthey considered appropriate for their patients. It was also expedient to make \nas little noise as possible about their use of a medicine which was already \nregarded as suspect within their own ranks. In any case, most of their research \ntime was spent on provings, in order to expand the number of known and useful \nmedicines, and very little on clinical trials.\nAs a result, it took an event of considerable magnitude to bring the \nmedicine out into the open, and the European cholera epidemic of 1832, two \nyears before Hahnemann's death, was just such an occasion. By the accounts of \nall observers, the homoeopaths had a far higher recovery rate than the \nallopaths, and it is recounted that in Paris, the price of the homoeopathic \nmedicine for cholera increased 100-fold. In Russia (where it is said the \nepidemic originated), the report from the Consul General showed that of the \n1,270 cases treated homeopathically, 1,162 recovered, and only 108 died, giving \na mortality rate of less than 10 percent. By contrast, the mortality rate from \nallopathic treatment was 60 to 70 percent.\nFollowing the homoeopathic success in the epidemic, medical interest in \nhomoeopathy increased at a rapid rate, and by the time of the next European \ncholera epidemic in 1854, the London Homoeopathic Hospital was already \nestablished. Its facilities were turned over entirely to the treatment of \ncholera victims, and the results were impressive. The homoeopathic death rate \nwas 16.4 percent, compared to the allopathic death rate of 51.8 percent. \nSimilar successful figures were reluctantly reported by a number of other \ncountries. Detailed returns for Britain had to be made by all hospitals and \npractitioners as to treatment and results in cholera, and the totals submitted \nby the British Medical Council in their Blue Book of Statistics. However, the \nfigures from the Homoeopathic Hospital were deliberately omitted, and were only \nproduced after considerable protest. The official reason for the omission was \nthat inclusion of the homoeopathic figures \"would give an unjustifiable \nsanction to an empirical practice, alike opposed to the maintenance of truth \nand the progress of science.\"\nThis prejudiced and bigoted reaction to the success of homoeopathic \nmedicine is typical of the problem which has plagued the advance of science for \nmany centuries. Orthodox medicine, in particular, is well known for its poor \ntrack record in meeting innovative change and research breakthroughs with the \nproper degree of scientific detachment and quiet encouragement. Even within \ntheir own ranks, some of the greatest of innovators, such as Lister, Jenner, \nand Harvey, suffered ridicule and professional ostracism over discoveries which \nlater became mainstays of medical practice. In reaction to homoeopathic \nsuccesses, the modern orthodox call has been for more clinical trials. Give us \ncontrolled trials, many allopaths have said, and if successful, we will accept \nthe medicine.\nSince that time, a number of clinical trials have been run, but many of \nthem with poor controls. Some of the better run trials are summarized here \nbriefly. Those looking for a more complete list could do no better than the \nexcellent review of Scofield.\nMustard Gas\nThe best controlled of the early clinical trials was conducted jointly in \nLondon and Glasgow during the second world war, to find a method of prevention \nand treatment of mustard gas burns. Mustard gas in the 30c potency, given as a \npreventative, reduced the incidence of deep and medium burns significantly. The \nremedies Rhus tox and Kali bich also gave statistically significant results in \ntreatment.\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nMore recent trials were conducted in 1978 at the Glasgow Homoeopathic \nHospital, now emerging as a stronghold of homoeopathic research. Gibson and \nco-workers conducted a double-blind comparison of a range of homoeopathic \nremedies (matched against the individual symptom pictures), and compared the \nresponses to those of salicylates and placebo in the treatment of rheumatoid \narthritis. They showed that the patients who received homoeopathic remedies \nresponded statistically better than those who received salicylates; moreover 42 \npercent of the homoeopathic group were able to discontinue all other treatment \nduring the year.\nObjections to the method of trial led to a more rigidly designed trial in \n1980, where patients were given either a homoeopathic medicine or placebo, but \nwere allowed to continue with their orthodox anti-inflammatory drugs. The \nhomoeopathic group showed significant improvement as judged by a number of \ntests, as compared to the patients who received placebo. It was noted that \nhomoeopathy was a safer and no less effective alternative to present day second \nline drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\nHay Fever - The Crack Widens\nOne of the most recent clinical trials, and certainly the most tightly \ncontrolled to date, was conducted in 1986 at the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital \nby Dr David Taylor Reilly, an allopath by training. The claim that homoeopathic \nmedicines are placebo was tested in a randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial. The effects of a homoeopathic preparation of mixed \ngrass pollens (30c potency, no molecules of the original pollen remaining) was \ncompared with those of placebo in a total of 144 patients with active hay \nfever. The homeopathically treated patients showed a statistically significant \nreduction in symptoms as assessed by both patient and physician. No evidence \nemerged to support the idea that placebo action explains the clinical response \nto homoeopathic remedies.\nThe publishing of this latter paper in the Lancet, arguably the most \nprestigious medical journal in the world, indicated the depth of penetration of \nhomoeopathic medicine into the allopathic world. The controversy it produced \nindicated the degree of crystallization of the collective allopathic brain. \nHere at last was proof positive in the much upheld double-blind trial, yet the \ncollective reaction was less than positive. Although some of the more \nfar-sighted of the correspondents suggested the possibility that a new \nchemistry and a new physics had been born, the reliance on pharmacology in the \nallopathic way of thinking showed its dominance. Reactions to drugs are caused \nby molecules of drug substance interacting with various body components, the \nthinking goes, and if there are no drug molecules in a medicine then there is \nno reaction aside from placebo effects. The experiment was simply testing one \nplacebo against another. The fact that statistical significance was obtained \nfor one of the `placebos' was apparently deemed of no consequence, and \nindicates that the issue may not be a scientific issue at all, but more an \neconomic and emotional one.\nPharmacological Support\nLogically, one of the first areas to investigate for support (or the lack \nof it) in homoeopathy is the area of pharmacology, or drug action. And contrary \nto expectations, some surprising support is appearing.\nAsk a pharmacologist about the biological effect of very low concentrations \nof common substances on living organisms and the answer will be that there is \ntypically very little or zero response. Ask for some theoretical backup, and in \nshort order you will find yourself confronted by one of the pharmacological \ntools of trade, the Dose - Response Curve. In brief, the curve illustrates one \nof the rules of thumb in drug use: that an increased dose of a drug will give \nan increased effect, while a lowered dose of a drug will give a reduced effect, \nand a very low dose will give no effect at all.\n A glance at the curve in Figure 3 will show that the pharmacologically \nrecommended dose of a drug lies in the area of the ED50, the dose which \nproduces 50% of the total or maximal effect. The homoeopathic area of interest, \non the other hand, lies at the very start of the curve, in the area of the \nso-called threshold dose.\n  \n\nThe area of the threshold dose is usually avoided in standard \npharmacological drug testing, for two reasons. The first is that the threshold \ndose lies some distance from the area of the ED50, so investigating this area \nfor drug reaction is basically a waste of time. But the other reason is far \nmore interesting. The threshold dose is an area where paradoxical and \ncontradictory results are obtained, not easily explained in conventional terms. \nAgain, the easy answer is to simply avoid it in experimentation. But the bottom \nline is that for many years the pharmacologists have known of the strange \nresults obtained in the threshold dose area, but have simply chosen to ignore \nthem. In doing so, they had unwittingly withdrawn orthodox support for an \nentirely different field of medicine. It is interesting that one of the \nvery earliest laws of pharmacology, known as the Arndt - Schulz Law, had \nalready expressed the homoeopathic effect. Formulated by Arndt in 1888, and \nrestated by Hueppe a few years later, the law set the groundwork for what \nshould have been a side-by-side development of allopathic and homoeopathic \nmedicine in the following century. It states: For every substance, small doses \nstimulate, moderate doses inhibit, large doses kill.\u00a0 \n\nAllopathic medicine, with its emphasis on moderate drug doses, works in the \ninhibitory part of the scale. The result is seen in the typically inhibitory \nmedicines produced: antihistamines, antibiotics, antacids, cough suppressants \nand so on, laying the basis for the so-called `suppressant' effect of drugs.\nHomoeopathic medicine, on the other hand, begins at the stimulatory end of \nthe curve, and moves to the left, into the smaller and smaller dose range. Its \nemphasis is on the stimulation of the body's natural balancing mechanisms, as \nseen in its philosophy of the natural regeneration of the body through \nrebuilding of vitality, a concept also in close agreement with naturopathic \nthought.\nThe pioneering work of Boyd bound the worlds of homoeopathy and \nArndt-Schulz together in the early 1940s with a series of tightly controlled \nexperiments, and set the stage for work much later on as to how homoeopathic \nmedicine may work. Boyd worked with the enzyme malt diastase, which was already \nknown to be inhibited by crude doses of the salt mercuric chloride, and \nmeasured its speed in the hydrolysis of starch. He also used a number of \nhomeopathically prepared dilutions of mercuric chloride, including a batch at \n61x, where there was no likelihood of any of the original salt remaining - it \nwas pure water. He also worked with distilled water as a control. He showed \nthat crude doses of mercuric chloride inhibited diastase activity, as was \nalready well known, and that distilled water had no effect. But he also showed, \nwith statistically significant results, that mercuric chloride 61x accelerated \ndiastase activity.\n Now this experiment had a number of ramifications, besides supporting the \nArndt-Schulz Law. If there was no mercuric chloride in the 61x potency, the it \nshould have reacted the same as distilled water. If, on the other hand, there \nwas a contamination of mercuric chloride somehow in the test doses, then the \nactivity of the enzyme should have decreased. Instead it did neither, but \nincreased, from the laboratory point of view, homoeopathic medicines not only \nhad been showed to work according to the Arndt-Schulz Law, but had been shown \nto affect enzyme action.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHormesis: The New Breakthrough\nLook up the Arndt-Schulz Law in a modern textbook of pharmacology, and you \nwill be lucky if you find it mentioned, let alone discussed. It died out of the \ntextbooks as the allopathic interest moved further into the inhibitory part of \nthe Arndt-Schulz curve, and as the pharmacological Dose - Response curve \navoided the area of the threshold dose. It appeared that, for all its promising \norigins, theoretical support for homoeopathy had died a natural death.\nRecently, however, further support for homoeopathic medicine has come from \na most unlikely direction: the field of toxicology, or the action of poisons. \nBeginning in 1960, data began to accumulate that poisonous substances were \nhaving two effects on living organisms5. At high doses they inhibited \nmetabolism and ultimately caused death, as was well known. But at low doses \nthey exerted a stimulating effect, a response totally unexpected and not \nexplainable by current medical science. Recently the trickle turned to a \ntorrent, as toxicologists turned to examine the new phenomenon of hormesis, the \nname given to the stimulatory effect of low levels of usually poisonous \nsubstances. The Arndt-Schulz Law had not died: it had simply resurfaced with a \nnew name.\nThe research results are incomplete, but the trend is inescapable. Evidence \nfrom experiments, both human and animal, shows hormesis as an effect occurring \nin all biological domains tested, with growing research support. It \ndemonstrates that all substances (including pesticides and carcinogens) which \nshow an inhibitory effect at high concentrations, have a stimulatory effect at \nlow concentrations.\n Typical Concentration-Response Curves Developed in Hormesis Research\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe alpha curve is the most expected pattern, and is assumed to describe \nthe actions of drugs in humans as the concentration moves from low \nconcentrations to progressively more inhibitory ones. This curve is a tentative \none, and is assigned to those drugs which have not yet been fully tested for a \nstimulatory response.\nThe beta curve was the most frequently observed pattern, and accounted for \nthe human reactions to the bulk of the drugs tested. It shows a typical curve \nas predicted by the Arndt-Schulz Law, but (understandably) was not tested in \ntoxic and lethal dose ranges. \nThe two other curves the gamma and delta forms, were recorded where data \nwas available for biological response at lower dose ranges. However data points \nfor these ranges are generally less available, so the validity of these curves \nis unknown until further data is available.\nHomoeopathic research has consistently produced results showing the basic \ncurve structure of hormesis and the Arndt-Schulz Law. But the research goes \nfurther: as the drug substance is progressively diluted, the biological \nreaction alternates between stimulation and inhibition, as given by the \nhormesis gamma and delta curves. This periodic behavior is called rhythmicity \nby the homoeopaths, and represents one of the several great unexplained \nphenomena in homoeopathic action. But one factor is established: as the \ndilutions become extreme and the concentration of the source drug approaches \nzero, the biological reaction will also fade out unless the diluted solution is \nsuccussed in accord with traditional homoeopathic practice.\n\u00a0\n \n A typical rhythmicity curve of the homoeopathic remedy Prunus \nSpinosa\nThe implications of hormesis are enormous and deserve a story of their own, \nbut a few points here may give future directions.\n: Pesticides which are toxic to pests at high concentrations can cause a \nproliferation of their growth at lower concentrations, such as can occur in \nrainwater run-off and collecting river systems. The ecological value of their \nuse will tumble.\n: Any substance which causes cancer will likewise be shown to be \nanti-cancer in its action at a lower dose range.\n: The present tactic of various health departments in this country of \ngiving a herb in high doses to experimental animals (and then banning it in all \ndose ranges when tumors form) will become counterproductive. Any herb which \ncauses cancer in high doses will be shown to protective against the same cancer \nin low dose ranges, suitable for human intake.\nHow Does Homoeopathy Work?\nCentral to the issue of medical acceptance of homoeopathy is the \nclarification of its mechanism of action. In particular, is there a model which \nadequately explains its clinical effectiveness and the successes of the trials?\n\nIn the development of a workable model, the research thinking has gone \nsomething like this: Given that the medicine is effective even when it can be \nshown that there is no likelihood of any molecules left in a particular dose \n(due to dilution), then the effect of the dose must lie with the water \nmolecules themselves, since that is all that is left. Water itself can be \nassumed to have no effect in this case, since the dose is small, and the effect \nwould always be the same. The answer must lie within the water molecules, and \nthe only real possibility is in the type of energy that the molecule has stored.\n\nEnergy storage within molecules in biological systems lies within the realm \nof biophysics rather than biochemistry. Biophysics is a new field, having \nbecome established only within the last twenty years or so. It is not yet \nincluded in medical curricula in universities to any great extent, and is only \nnow beginning to make its mark in the biological sciences. Small wonder, \ntherefore, that the established medical world knows little of its existence, or \nthe promise it holds in explaining the action of the medicines of energy, such \nas homoeopathy, acupuncture, psychic and spirit healing, and radionics.\nEnergy Storage\nMolecules such as water can store energy in four different ways - kinetic, \nspin, vibration and electronic excitation. Some storage modes can store more \nenergy than others, and we will start at the lowest, least energetic mode, \nwhich is kinetic energy, or energy of motion. A molecule stores kinetic energy \nby virtue of its speed. It is this storage in gases and liquids which causes \npressure (such as air pressure) by the continual collision of the molecules \nwith surfaces like our skin, and also causes the bulk of chemical reactions to \noccur. At room temperature, the energy which these molecules contain is low, \ncompared with other states. It is unsuited to homoeopathic medicine since the \nenergy is constantly altered by collision, and so any energy stored is degraded.\n\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Energy Storage In Molecules\nSpin and Microwave Cooking\nSpin energy is found in gases and liquids, but not in solids, where the \nstronger attractions between molecules prevents rotation. It is also not found \nin water until about 420C, a factor of considerable importance to living \norganisms, composed as they are of up to 90 percent water, with humans being \nabout 40 percent. Heating up water to about 42 degrees causes sufficient \ndisruption of the molecular attraction between molecules to allow spin to \noccur, and that's precisely the temperature at which humans start to die. Life \nprocesses in general seem to keep a safe distance from the temperature band of \n42 to 45 degrees.\nSpin energy in molecules corresponds to microwave radiation, which is one \nreason why this radiation is lethal. It is also an indication of the potential \npower of energy storage in this mode - strong enough to cook food. But it is \nunsuited to homoeopathic medicine, since at room temperature, the spin storage \nstate in water has not become active.\nElectronic Excitation\nAt the top end of the scale is electronic excitation, which is the stuff \npowering lasers, of great strength and intensity. Excite the electrons circling \nthe component molecules up into higher orbits and energy is stored. Drop them \ndown together, and a pulse of light is given out. It may be of sufficient \nstrength and power to burn a hole through a razor blade, cut tissue in surgery, \nor stop an army tank - it depends on what molecules are used, and how strongly \nthe electrons are excited. It is not suitable for homoeopathic medicine, \nbecause the excited electrons are unstable, and will decay in a matter of \nfractions of a second.\nVibratory Storage \nStanding midway between the cooking power of microwave and the destructive \npower of lasers stands vibratory energy. Although it has an accepted place in \nphysics as a means of storing energy, it has had a chequered career in medical \nscience because of its association with trance mediums, psychic phenomena and \nextrasensory perception. Vibratory energy can be found in molecules throughout \nall three states of matter - solid, liquid and gas. It is responsible for \nphenomena such as the expansion of metals when heated, and the transfer of heat \nby conduction. Vibratory motion of a molecule increases when the molecule \nabsorbs energy, and can re-radiate it at a later date, usually in the infrared \npart of the spectrum, where heat is also found.\nIt is in the storage of vibratory energy in water molecules during the \nsuccussion process that homoeopathic medicine places many of its hopes for a \nscientific explanation of its action. It is proposed that during the collision \nprocess, vibratory energy is exchanged between the source drug and the water, \nand that the water is left with a vibratory imprint of the drug. Further \nsuccussion makes the imprint deeper, which explains why the medicines are \nregarded as acting more strongly as the dilution increases. Furthermore it is \nnot just energy which is being stored, it is proposed, but information, \ndiffering from one remedy to another depending on the source substance used, \nwith every substance leaving a different vibratory signature in the water \nmolecule. In this way homoeopathic medicine is seen as carrying information \ninto the body when it is taken in dose form, perhaps as biological instructions.\n\nIf water molecules were dissociated from each other at room temperature, \nany vibratory energy stored would quickly degrade. But at 250C, about 70% of \nwater molecules are incorporated into a stable hexagonal lattice structure, \ncapable of storing a considerable amount of vibratory energy before it breaks \nup. But storage of vibratory energy causes structural changes, because any \nmolecule which absorb energy will always change its shape. So a convenient way \nof telling if this particular model was correct was to examine homoeopathic \nwater for structural changes.\nA number of workers over the years have shown that both high and low \npotency homoeopathic medicines show structural changes in the water they \ncontain. It was additionally shown that in order for the structural changes to \noccur, two things must happen. First, there must be a source drug to begin \nwith; that is, you can't make a homoeopathic medicine from water alone. \nSecondly, you must succuss the remedy as it is diluted stepwise, in the \nrhythmic shaking manner used by the homoeopaths for many years. Only when these \ntwo processes are included will structural changes show.\n\u00a0 \nCertainly one of the most visually impressive experiments to test the \npossibility of structural changes was carried out recently, involving ice \ncrystals. Ice crystal structures are very good mirrors of the energy status of \ntheir component water molecules. It is why, for instance, you will never find \ntwo identical snowflake patterns, for each is formed under slightly different \nconditions. In the experiment, different potencies of the homoeopathic remedy \nPulsatilla were frozen at -100C, and photographed under polarized light to show \nany changes in the ice crystal structure. The results are strikingly beautiful, \nand the changes in crystal size as the potencies increase indicate increased \nenergy storage in vibratory modes.\nIce Crystal Photos Here\nBenveniste - Champion or Charlatan?\nIn one of the stranger episodes in the recorded history of scientific \npublishing, the prestigious British research journal Nature recently published \nexperimental results which the editors say they consider utterly impossible. \nThe typically indigestible title of the paper is \"Human Basophil \nDegranulation Triggered by Very Dilute Antiserum Against IgE, and the \nconclusions it proposes have been similarly indigestible to the medical \ncommunity. The main players in the experiment were a special type of white \nblood cell known as a basophil and an antibody, IgE. When basophils are \nnormally exposed to this antibody, their chemistry and internal structure \nchange, in a way that is easily checked by staining techniques. But what \nBenveniste and his colleagues found was that the changes occurred even when the \nantibody was used up to the 120x potency, a dilution at which it is virtually \nimpossible for even one molecule of the antibody to remain. The results also \nshowed the familiar rhythmic changes in basophil reactions as the potencies \nincreased, a factor still unexplained, even by homoeopaths. The deputy editor \nof Nature remarked that two centuries of observation and rational thinking \nabout biology will have to be abandoned if the results stand, because they \ncannot be explained by existing physical laws.\nThe 13 member international research team headed by Professor Benveniste \nconducted their experiments after being challenged by two eminent French \nhomoeopaths to disprove homoeopathy once and for all, by conducting a \nsensitive, tightly controlled experiment in an accredited research centre. The \ncentre chosen was at the University of South Paris, where Professor Benveniste \nis a Research Director. \"That was how it all started\", he said. \n\"They challenged us to prove them wrong, and we couldn't.\"\nThe furor surrounding this experiment has produced some unique reactions \nwithin the scientific community, and highlights an important question: how \nshould the scientific establishment deal with anomalous findings which \nchallenge the very roots of established thought? Nature journal had its own \nanswer: it sent a fraud squad comprising one of its editors, a professional \nmagician, and an investigator of scientific frauds from the USA to Benveniste's \nlaboratories. Over a period of a week they criticized shortcomings in \nexperimental design, studied the laboratory records, and interrogated the \nresearchers. Finally, they failed to replicate the results in a double-blind \ntrial, and declared the experiments \"a delusion.\" Benveniste, not \nunexpectedly, considered the investigation a witch hunt and an outrage. \"I \nwelcome any explanation for our findings\" he said, \"but not this kind \nof crap.\"\nThe homoeopaths of the world, together with interested onlookers, can be \nassured that the matter will not rest there. Further interesting reading on the \nbizarre reactions to homoeopathic experiments on the part of the scientific and \nmedical establishments will surface. Benveniste will undoubtedly be back, with \na more tightly controlled experiment which will probably decide, once and for \nall, the future of homoeopathy.\nReferences:\n1.

The Nuclear Mechanism\n 5. Mechanism of the Effect On The \nOrganism\n 6. The Future\n1. Introduction\nHahnemann and Homoeopathy \nSince its inception in 1796 by the German physician and experimental \npharmacologist Samuel Hahnemann, homoeopathy has survived but is still a \nmedical fringe discipline.\nHahnemann published his Organon in 1810, one year before Avogadro presented \nhis hypothesis that there are 6.02 x 1023 molecules of a substance in 1 gram \nmolecular weight. The solutions used in homoeopathy are both diluted and \nsuccussed, and in this case means that a substance has been diluted through a \nserial process in such a way that the dilution of the original drug may \napproach Avogadro's number and even exceed it. Since a one molar solution \nstepwise diluted to the 12c potency is unlikely to contain even one molecule of \nsolute, and a basic tenet of homoeopathy is that solutions which have no active \ndrug molecules can still have effects on the human organism, homoeopathy has \nmet with substantial opposition from pharmacology.\nEven 200 years after Hahnemann's discoveries, homoeopathy still lacks a \ntheoretical foundation. Experimental studies on the nature of homoeopathic \nsolutions have reported many changes: there are reported alterations in the \ninfrared spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times, surface \ntension, dielectric constant, and a handful of other parameters. Biological \nstudies have shown marked changes in enzyme speed, cardiac rate, muscle \ncontraction and plant growth, to name but a few. Clinical trials are showing \nconsistently better results as experimental design is improved. But experiments \nhave been plagued by lack of reproducibility, and data could not be \nconsistently interpreted. A number of models had been proposed to explain \nhomoeopathic action, the most popular being the water memory model, but all \nmodels have been fairly speculative.\nThe French Team\nEnter Rolland Conte and team from the field of economics. After many years \nof research in economics and macroeconomic forecasting, the French researchers \nConte, Berliocchi, and Andras introduced in their book Nouvelle Economie \nTheorique a new mathematical theory known as Ether theory, and a new \nstatistical tool known as Contonian statistics.\nAt the beginning of 1993 the team of Conte, Berliocchi, Lasne and Vernot \napplied these same mathematical techniques to the field of homoeopathy. They \nformulated a mathematical representation of high dilution effects using quantum \nfield theory. In their book, Theory Of High Dilutions, they provide the results \nof their measurements and the rationale for its interpretation. The theory is \ninnovative, high-tech, and breaks much new ground. The model they present may \nalso explain, after so long, how homoeopathic medicine works.\nRolland Conte is a PhD in applied physics, with extensive experience in \neconomics and macroeconomic forecasting, and the inspirational force behind \nContonian statistics. Henri Berliocchi is a mathematician with a brilliant \nhistory, who provided the ether theory and the physico-mathematical model. Yves \nLasne is a doctor of medicine, doctor of science, who provided the detection \ntechnology and research methodology, based on measurement of nuclear magnetic \nresonance and beta radiation. Gabriel Vernot is an engineer and computer \nscientist working in aerospace applications, and who provided the dedicated \nAAPDI software. \nAs early as 1985 Lasne had repeated earlier work showing evidence of \nchanges in the infrared spectrum of homoeopathic solutions, and had \ndemonstrated significant variation of T2 relaxation times in nuclear magnetic \nresonance studies over a range of centesimal dilutions. Lasne also reported \nevidence of radiation coming from the test samples. Contonian statistical \nanalysis of NMR results and \u00e1-radiation began on a range of raw high \ndilution data. The analysis is run on dedicated Ecosem software called AAPDI, \nwhich stands for Analyse Activite Pharmacologique Dilutions Infinitesimales.\nAnalysis of infrared and NMR data produced a number, known as a Contonian \nfrequency, even from data which at first glance was not reproducible or \nconsistent with other experimentation. The Contonian frequency for a remedy is \nreproducible, given stable external variables. Every remedy has a unique \nContonian frequency, offering a likely measuring tool by which quality control \nand formulation efficiency can be evaluated. In the history of homoeopathic \nmanufacture, we have never had such a measuring tool; and as they say in \nscience, if you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.\nIn essence, the French team have proposed a model for homoeopathic action \nbased on classical quantum theory, a new mathematical theory, and a statistical \ntool for linking theory and experimental data. They have produced experimental \nverification of their model based on NMR work, and on beta-radiation \nmeasurements. The use of Contonian statistics has led to quantifiable results.\n\n2. The Contonian Model\nMathematical and physical frameworks are presented which use classical \nquantum theory and quantum field theory. They require a strong background in \nphysics and higher mathematics to appreciate their insights. The researchers \nreport that their physico-mathematical model proposed is in accord with \nexperimental results, and answers questions raised by considerations of high \ndilution and water memory.\nThe Mathematical Framework\nThe mathematical framework provides a theory for interpreting high dilution \nphenomena using quantum mathematics. It involves set theory and probabilistic \nmodeling, and uses mathematical operators such as lagrangians in a way that \nwould make your head swim. It involves:\n. The use of real numbers as defined within the set theory known as the \nZermelo-Frenkel theory.\n. In handling classical quantum theory, another axiom, known as the choice \naxiom, is used in addition to the Zermelo-Frenkel theory.\n. An additional axiom, known as Solovay's axiom, is used.\n. A model of real numbers, known as Levy's model, is used jointly with \nSolovay's axiom and consideration of the Brownian motion of water molecules to \nestablish the water memory model.\n. A general mechanism for interpreting data, known as semiotic mechanics, \nhas been introduced. This mechanism had been previously validated by \nBerliocchi, one of the authors, within his theory of ethers.\nThe Physical Model\nWithin the physical model, a number of events have been proposed and \nmeasured.\n White holes\nThe disappearance of drug molecules during dilution leads to a dislocation \nin the solvent known as a singularity. This singularity has been termed a white \nhole. It can be thought of a small but highly energized area of space.\nThe remanent wave\nThe appearance of a singularity induces a wave which has been termed a \nremanent wave. It can be thought of as a set of ripples in a pond when a stone \nis dropped in. A remanent wave is always created when a particle disappears and \nleaves a white hole, and the number of remanent waves is proportional to the \nnumber of particles lost. When one continues the release at the same place and \nin a regularly spaced way, the waves produced are in phase and the amplitude \nincreases. When no further stones are released, the ripples disappear within a \ncertain time, and the wave energy is slowly released in the water as heat. This \ncan be measured using standard equipment such as infrared absorption \nspectrophotometers.\n Nuclear transformations\nThe appearance of a white hole and a remanent wave induces nuclear \nreactions in the high dilution medium. The creation of tritium, an isotope of \nhydrogen in water, results in the subsequent decay of a tritium neutron into an \nelectron, a proton and a particle known as an anti-graviton which has no mass \nand no charge. Beta radiation can be detected. There are changes in NMR and in \nthe infrared. Beta radiation is associated with electrons, while infrared is \ncommonly known as heat. The energy of a remanent wave of a diluted-succussed \nsolutions is around 1 KeV. For a high dilution of HNO3, measurement of the beta \nenergy spectrum gives a frequency of 2.4 x 1017 Hz. This is a very high \nfrequency, the wavelength range lying in a band from 1.25 and 10 nanometres. By \ncomparison, the period of vibration of the helicoil nucleic acid chain of DNA \nis equal to 3.4 nanometres. This means that the DNA can act as a \ntransmitter-receiver antenna. In essence, nuclear transformations in the test \ntube at room temperature are being proposed, although the efficiency is low. \nThis was reported many years ago by Kerveran, another Frenchman, who wrote on \nbiological transmutation within living organisms.\n Hyperprotons\nAbove the Avogadro limit, no more white holes are produced, but there is a \ncontinued stimulation from succussion termed hyperproton expansion. \nHyperprotons are seen as the missing link between chemistry and biochemistry. \nThey are considered as particles that phase in and out of space-time. This is \nthe basis of the relativistic and quantum theory of fields, the current theory \nin physics covering matter-energy interactions. The theory of hyperprotons uses \nthe so-called second quantisation theory of Dirac for a free material particle \nin space-time: Dirac in 1933 proposed the emergence of a real electron from a \nsea of virtual electrons, sometimes called the second quantisation. Hyperproton \nexpansion produces irradiation effects on surrounding matter, and reorganises \nthe solvent structure. Such a field has been measured, and is calculated by \nrenormalisation through the integral of Feynman. Hydrogen and oxygen \nlagrangians on data measured at 300 Mhz in NMR studies indicate a \nre-organization of the water structure. This provides evidence for the \nexistence of a new quantum state, whose nature has not been fully elucidated.\n\n Potencies exhibit phase changes\nNMR studies show that the impregnation of lactose granules with succussed \npreparations produces an effective transfer but induces a phase displacement in \nthe primary signal, the extent of phase displacement depending on the nature of \nthe source drug and the potency. The general form of the phase displacement is \na sinusoid. For sulphur dilutions around 300c, the displacement is 1800 out of \nphase. By contrast, histamine shows a very small phase displacement. Solutions \nwhich exhibit a 1800 phase displacement have an opposite effect on test systems \n(pea root length, frog leg metamorphosis) compared with solutions 00 out of \nphase. Hence stimulation of a test system at one dilution can be altered to \ninhibition at another dilution.\n Effects not due to contaminants\nAn experimental approach was developed which demonstrated that the effects \nobtained were not due to the presence of contaminants in the diluent. The use \nof the contonian frequency indicates that the specific activity of high \ndilutions are reproducible within experimental error as long as external \nvariables are controlled.\nThe Axioms Of The Contonian Model\nAs a result of these findings, two axioms have been formulated:\nAxiom 1\nThe dilution-succussion process induces an effect which can be directly \nmeasured by physical and biological experiments.\nAxiom 2\nAn informational message will be produced only if at least one substance \nexists in the diluent at the start of the process.\n3. Impact of Environmental Factors On The Remanent Wave\nContonian frequency calculations indicate that the specific activity of \nhigh dilutions is reproducible at any time provided that external variables are \ncontrolled, such as:\n. Temperature. \n. Light.\n. The amount of energy introduced by the succussion process.\n. Moon phases. \n. Gravitational forces. \n. Other external influences such as ultrasound.\nSome of these findings come as no surprise, as they appear to validate some \nissues known to the profession by experience.\n. The sensitivity of homoeopathic medicines to light and temperature is \nwell accepted amongst the homoeopathic profession.\n. More surprising is the sensitivity to factors such as the phases of the \nmoon and changes in geomagnetic flux. However it has been said by many \nhomoeopaths that some remedies are better given at particular phases of the \nmoon.\n. It has also been suggested that homoeopathic medicines do not travel well \nbecause it involves moving though the magnetic field of the earth.\n. It is also worth mentioning that the sensitivity of manufacture of high \ndilutions to changes in geomagnetic flux and gravitational flux was predicted \nin the physical model by the appearance of an anti-graviton during beta \nemission.\nThe need for a consistent medicine to be manufactured in a machine where \nthe succussion speed and stroke length are optimized and consistent has led to \nthe patented development of a succussion device.\n4. The Nuclear Transformation Mechanism\nAs previously proposed, white hole creation leads to an irradiation of \ndiluted-succussed solutions due to a neutron type field induced by the remanent \nwave. This irradiation will create, on the one hand hydrogen isotopes deuterium \n(1 proton and 1 neutron) and tritium (1 proton and 2 neutrons), or on the other \nhand oxygen O17. The efficiency of this nuclear reaction is known to be low. \nWith regard to tritium, the neutron splits and releases 1 proton and 1 \n\u00e1- electron and an anti-graviton.\nAutoradiography techniques have shown \u00e1-radiation emitted from \ngranules impregnated with a preparation of potassium iodide, with no radiation \nbeing detected from controls. For dilutions up to 12c, beta radiation is \nexpected to predominate, seeing that the level of succussion is low.\nIn dilutions higher than Avogadro, no more white holes are created. Neutron \ndisintegration releases energy into a medium which already has a high proton \ncontent. The protons are then transformed into hyperprotons, which are \nconsidered as virtual particles that can phase in and out of space-time. They \nmay also appear within the space-time singularities as nuclear protons. These \nhyperprotons will stabilize one part of the diluent structure (a local effect) \nthat will then be able to influence the non structured part of the diluent.\n5. Mechanism of the Effect On The Organism\nA quantum model called Theory of Universal Wave Function has been proposed, \nto describe the effect of high dilutions on living organisms. They have \nproposed that intoxication of an organism by a toxic solution such as CCl4 \ninduces a deviation from a state of health as indicated by a vector, and a \nphase displacement. Treatment of the organism with a high dilution of the \ncorrectly chosen remedy with a counteracting phase displacement restores the \norganism to its original vector and a healthy state.\nTo illustrate this proposal, the effect of dilutions of thyroxin upon the \nmetamorphosis of tadpoles of the grass frog were studied. When added to the \naqueous medium, diluted and succussed thyroxin can inhibit or accelerate larval \ndevelopment of the forelegs, depending on the dilution. On the basis of phase \ndisplacements, it is suggested that when the thyroxin preparation is in phase \nwith the larval organism, the thyroxin acts as a booster for the transformation \nfrom the two legged to the four legged stage. When the thyroxin preparation is \nnot in phase with the larval development, it inhibits metamorphosis. It was \nalso noted that different effects were produced in the organism, depending on \nwhether the solutions were succussed or not.\nThe specificity of diluted-succussed solutions is remarkable, even if an \nenzyme system specific of a given diluted-succussed solution has not been \nfound. Interaction between two remanent waves induces a generalized and fast \naction on the organism. When such an interaction does not occur, the solution \nsimply has no impact on the organism. The specificity of the diluted-succussed \nsolution takes place within phase space.\nSubstantial interest has been centered on the enzyme peroxidase, which is \nseen as decoding structures introduced by the dilution-succussion process and \ninducing a proton flow within the organism. This has substantial promise in the \nunderstanding of meridian flow structure within the organism, as well as \nshedding light on the findings of Boyd, nearly half a century ago, who showed \nthat homoeopathic potencies altered the speed of the enzyme diastase.\nThe processes of elimination and heart beat within the human body are \nproposed to fulfill all the requirements of white hole emergence. Remanent \nwaves are seen as pervading the whole organism in a normal state of health. \nFood denial or fasting for a short period is considered to improve the \nobservation of the remanent wave. As a result, a person may be considered as \nhaving a remanent wave profile, a situation offering great promise in \ntherapeutics.\n6.

A \nshort monologue was produced at comfortable loudness level and with noise in \nthe background. \n Results: Differences in respiratory strategies were demonstrated for the \ndifferent cueing conditions, similar to patterns observed in sentence \nproductions. The kinematic patterns were similar for reading and monologue; \nhowever, utterances were longer and speaking rate was slower in the monologue \ntask. \n Conclusion: The findings extend the results from sentences to connected \nspeech and provide support for the hypothesis that \"intention\" or \ngoals play a role in the control of respiratory function during speech. \nRespiratory kinematics were similar across tasks, when the same cue was used, \nexcept for differences related to breath group length and speech rate. \n \nKEY WORDS:  normal respiration, vocal loudness, speech \nmotor control\n Studying the responses of the respiratory system to changes in vocal \nloudness is of interest to speech scientists because changing loudness can be \nviewed as a natural perturbation to the speech system. It is well accepted that \nspeakers vary vocal intensity and subglottal pressure within and across \nutterances (cf. Ladefoged, 1967; Winkworth, Davis, Ellis, & Adams, 1994). \nStudies that utilize changes in loudness as an experimental condition extend \nour current speculations about the neural control of the speech system (Tasko \n& McClean, 2004). Further, because many therapeutic strategies with adults \nwith neuromotor control diseases incorporate changes to loudness, studies \nincorporating loudness changes provide information related to the use of cues \nto increase loudness with individuals with speech difficulties. The current \nstudy examined the response of the respiratory system to three cues used to \nelicit increased vocal loudness during reading and monologue. \n Several studies have examined respiratory characteristics of speech \nproduction during connected speech tasks, including reading, conversation, \nmonologue, and extemporaneous speech, at comfortable loudness levels (cf. \nHixon, Goldman, & Mead, 1973; Hogde & Rochet, 1989; Hoit & Hixon, \n1987; Hoit, Hixon, Altman, & Morgan, 1989; Solomon & Hixon, 1993; \nWinkworth, Davis, Adams, & Ellis, 1995; Winkworth et al., 1994). In these \nstudies, the connected speech tasks resulted in similar respiratory kinematics \nfor the most part. Speech was produced in the mid-lung volume (LV) range, \ninitiated above end expiratory level (EEL), and terminated at or above EEL. For \nlonger utterances, speech was sometimes terminated farther below EEL than for \nshorter utterances. The results were similar for the rib cage (RC) and \nabdominal measurements, although abdominal initiations and terminations may be \nlower in reading than in conversation (Solomon & Hixon, 1993). \n Previous studies of respiratory kinematics with increased loudness have \nprimarily used syllable train tasks and sentence tasks (Dromey & Ramig, 1998\n;Huber, Chandrasekaran, & Wolstencroft, 2005; Stathopoulos & Sapienza, \n1997). Stathopoulos and Sapienza (1997) demonstrated that subjects, age 4 years \nto young adult, increased the volume at which speech was initiated when asked \nto speak 5 dB above comfortable loudness. Dromey and Ramig (1998) found that \nsubjects initiated speech at a higher LV when asked to speak at 4 times their \ncomfortable loudness level. One of the only studies to examine changes to \nrespiratory kinematics with increased loudness during connected speech was by \nHixon et al. (1973), who reported that LV initiations (LVI) and LV excursions \n(LVE) were higher in loud reading, as compared to comfortable reading. \n Increasing loudness often involves increased subglottal pressure (\nHolmberg, Hillman, & Perkell, 1988; Isshiki, 1964; Stathopoulos & \nSapienza, 1997). At least one study has found that the alteration of respiratory\npressures is the primary mechanism speakers use to increase subglottal pressure \nfor louder speech (Finnegan, Luschei, & Hoffman, 2000). Increasing volume \ninitiations has been suggested to be an efficient mechanism for increasing \nloudness. Passive recoil pressure is higher at higher LV (Rahn, Otis, Chadwick, \n& Fenn, 1946); therefore, less muscular pressure needs to be applied to \ngenerate higher subglottal pressures for louder speech at those volumes. \n However, the finding that individuals increase the volume at which they \nstart to speak when increasing loudness has not been universally reported. \nDromey and Ramig (1998) did not find significant changes in LV initiation when \nasking subjects to speak twice as loudly as comfortable, even though asking \nthem to speak at 4 times comfortable loudness did result in higher speech \ninitiations. Winkworth and Davis (1997) used the Lombard effect as a cue to \nelicit louder speech in reading and monologue and found considerable \nvariability in respiratory kinematics. The Lombard effect is a phenomenon in \nwhich individuals automatically increase vocal loudness when background noise \nis present (Lane & Tranel, 1971; Pick, Siegel, Fox, Garber, & Kearney, \n1989). The participants increased loudness 10\u201316 dB sound pressure level \n(SPL) because of the Lombard effect (Winkworth & Davis, 1997). On average, \nhigher LV initiations and lower terminations were seen for both speech tasks \nwhen the individuals were speaking in noise. However, examination of the \ntrial-by-trial data did not demonstrate linear increases in LV initiation with \nincreased SPL. Winkworth and Davis (1997) hypothesized that the amount of \nvariability demonstrated in their study was related to the way the loud speech \nwas elicited, which did not focus the speaker's attention on the task of \nincreasing loudness. \n Central to Winkworth and Davis's (1997) interpretations was the question \nof cueing. Cues are prompts designed to assist an individual in obtaining a \ndesired output. They can vary in a number of ways, including the degree of \ncognitive, emotional, and physical demands they place on the individual. In \nprevious studies of respiratory kinematic changes with increased loudness, \nseveral cues have been used to elicit the increased loudness. Asking an \nindividual to target a specific SPL using an SPL meter, as was used by \nStathopoulos and Sapienza (1997), provides both an external goal and external \nfeedback and may add some cognitive load to the speech task because the \nindividual must monitor SPL meter while speaking. When an individual is asked \nto speak at 2 or 4 times comfortable loudness, as in Dromey and Ramig's (1998) \nstudy, there is no explicit external feedback about loudness; however, auditory \nfeedback is present. When an individual speaks in background noise, as used by \nWinkworth and Davis (1997), the change in loudness is likely to be automatic \nand not under much volitional control. The noise cue is the most natural of the \nthree cues presented here because speaking in noise is a common occurrence in \neveryday life. However, no explicit feedback about loudness is present, and \nauditory feedback is degraded to some extent because of the noise in the \nenvironment. \n To extend the findings from Winkworth and Davis (1997) and further examine \nthe role of cueing in respiratory control,Huber et al. (2005) examined the \neffects of three cues to increase loudness on respiratory kinematics in young \nadults producing two sentences. Both sentences were relatively short, 6 \nsyllables and 12 syllables. That study established that speakers use different \nrespiratory mechanisms to increase loudness depending on how they are cued. \nWhen speakers were asked to target a SPL about 10 dB above their comfortable \nSPL, they primarily increased lung and RC volume initiations and terminations, \nthereby utilizing higher recoil pressures to generate more subglottal pressure. \nWhen asked to speak at twice their perceived comfortable loudness, speakers did \nnot change lung or RC initiations or terminations, but instead, they used more \nexpiratory muscle tension to increase subglottal pressure as demonstrated by \nlower abdominal volume initiations (ABVI) and abdominal volume terminations \n(ABVT). When speaking in noise, participants used a combination of the \naforementioned strategies, increasing lung and RC initiations and terminations \nand decreasing abdominal initiations and terminations, but to a lesser extent \nthan under the other two cues. The trial-to-trial variability in respiratory \nkinematic data reported byHuber et al. (2005) in the noise condition was much \nlower than that reported by Winkworth and Davis (1997); however, the speech \ntask was different. It may be that production of sentences did not elicit the \nvariability that may be seen with a connected speech task when speaking in \nnoise. \n The data from Huber et al.'s (2005) study, that the type of cue used to \nelicit an increase in loudness is associated with different respiratory \nkinematic patterns, also provide evidence that respiratory function for speech \nis finely controlled and in tune with the perceived demands of the speech task. \nHuber et al. (2005) attributed the differences in respiratory mechanisms used to\nsupport louder speech among the three cueing conditions to differences in \ninternal targets elicited by the cues. Changes to putative internal targets \nhave been inferred from limb studies showing changes in movement patterns \nutilized to achieve a task. For example, in a study by Gentilucci, Benuzzi, \nBertolani, Daprati, and Gangitano (2000), reaching and grasping movements were \naltered as a result of the label on the target object. Objects were labeled \n\"large\" or \"small,\" regardless of the actual size of the \nobject. Kinematic patterns for reaching and grasping large and small objects \nlabeled \"small\" were similar. The same was true for large and small \nobjects labeled \"large.\" Therefore, the label on the object had a \ngreater effect on the movement pattern than the actual size of the object, \nsuggesting a change in how the individuals perceived the task or the goal of \nthe task as a result of the label. One possible interpretation of the data is \nthat an internal representation of the goal of a movement is reflected in the \nkinematics associated with achieving that goal. Extending these findings to \nconnected speech would suggest that the results of the study by Huber et al. \n(2005) reflect more global mechanisms in the movement control \nsystem\u2014whether movement representations are specifically involved\u2014and \nwould provide support for the hypothesis that respiratory kinematics for speech \nare affected by the speaker's goal. \n There were two purposes of the current study. One was to examine how \nrespiratory kinematics changed with increased loudness during a connected \nspeech task. Specifically, it was of interest whether the effect of cueing on \nrespiratory kinematics was a function of the sentence task used by Huber et al. \n(2005) or whether it was present in connected speech tasks. It was hypothesized \nthat similar respiratory mechanisms would be demonstrated during connected \nspeech under each of the cueing conditions, as were demonstrated during the \nsentence tasks inHuber et al.'s (2005) study. That finding would be consistent \nwith the view that cueing effects are relatively global in speech respiration. \nThe finding would also prepare a platform for future studies that will attempt \nto identify the specific mechanisms by which cues modulate kinematic pattering \nin speech breathing. \n Most of what is known about respiratory function for loud speech is based \non the production of syllable trains and sentences. Therefore, the second \npurpose of the current study was to examine whether the type of task (reading \nand monologue) affected respiratory kinematics both at comfortable loudness and \nwith background noise present. On the basis of previous research, it was \nexpected that there would be few differences in task performance at comfortable \nintensity level. It was hypothesized that the respiratory kinematic patterns \nfor loud speech would be similar across the reading and monologue tasks within \neach cueing condition. However, it was hypothesized that if differences in \nutterance length existed between the two tasks, these differences would result \nin lower LV terminations (LVT) and larger LVE in the task with longer breath \ngroups. \n Method\nParticipants\n \nThirty normal young adults, 15 women and 15 men, participated in this study. \nThe mean age of the women was 22 years, 4 months, and the mean age of the men \nwas 22 years, 10 months. Participants reported (a) no history of voice \nproblems, neurological disease, head or neck surgery, formal speaking or \nsinging training; (b) no recent colds or infections; and (c) they had been \nnonsmoking for the past 5 years. They had a body-mass index between 19 and 30; \nnormal speech, language, and voice; and General North American dialect of \nEnglish as judged by the author, a certified speech-language pathologist. \nParticipants passed a hearing screening at 30 dB HL for octave frequencies \nbetween 250 and 8000 Hz, bilaterally, completed in a quiet room. Participants \nhad normal vital capacity (VC), forced VC, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. \nNormal was defined as equal to or better than 80% of expected values based on \nage, sex, height, weight, and ethnicity as determined by algorithms running on \na digital spirometer (VacuMed Discovery Handheld Spirometer) that were drawn \nfrom several sets of published normative data for spirometry. \n Equipment\n The acoustic signal was transduced via a \ncondenser microphone that was connected to an SPL meter (Quest model 1700). The \nmicrophone was placed 6 in. (15.24 cm) from the participant's mouth, at a \n45\u00b0 angle. The microphone signal was recorded to digital audiotape and \nlater digitized into a PC using Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2003). The signal \nwas digitized at 44.1 kHz and resampled at 18 kHz. The resampling process \napplied a low-pass filter at 9000 Hz for anti-aliasing. \n Respiratory kinematic data were transduced via respiratory inductive \nplethesmography using the Respitrace system (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.). The \nfirst elastic band was placed around the RC, just under the axilla to transduce \nmovements of the RC. A second elastic band was placed around the abdomen (AB) \nat the level of the umbilicus, ensuring that it was below the last rib, to \ntransduce movements of the AB. Respiratory kinematic data were digitized at \n2000 Hz. Data from a second microphone were collected with these data so that \nan acoustic record would be digitized in combination with the respiratory \nkinematic data. \n Procedures and Speech Tasks\n Participants read a \ntwo-paragraph passage containing 11 sentences (Sapienza & Stathopoulos, 1995\n). The passage is presented in the Appendix. The reading passage was projected \nonto a computer screen. Each participant read the passage two times under each \nof the following conditions.\n\nCOMF: Participants were instructed to read the passage at their \ncomfortable pitch and loudness. \n\nCOMF+10: Participants were instructed to read the passage while \nmaintaining a specific SPL, using an SPL meter for feedback. The readout from \nthe SPL meter was projected onto a television screen that was placed next to \nthe computer screen displaying the reading passage. The targeted level was set \nat 10 dB above the participant's comfortable SPL (+/\u20132 dB). \n\n2xCOMF: Participants were instructed to read the paragraph at what they \nfelt was \"twice their comfortable loudness.\" \n\nNOISE: Participants were instructed to read the paragraph while noise was \nplayed in the background. The noise consisted of multitalker babbling noise \n(AUDiTEC of St. Louis), played at 70 dBA relative to the participants' ears. \nThe speakers were placed in front of the participants, approximately 39 in. \n(99.06 cm) away. \n \n These three cues to increase loudness have been used in previous studies \nof respiratory kinematic patterns with increased SPL. The conditions were \ndevised to elicit about the same amount of SPL increase. Winkworth and Davis \n(1997) found that their subjects increased SPL by at least 10 dB when \nmultitalker noise at 70 dBA was played while they were speaking. Psychophysical \nliterature has demonstrated that individuals perceive a sound that is 10 dB \nlouder than a referent as \"twice as loud\" (Stevens, 1955). Therefore, \nit was hypothesized that the cue to speak at \"twice comfortable \nloudness\" would elicit an SPL increase of 10 dB. The target for the SPL \nmeter condition was set at 10 dB above comfortable on the basis of the \nexpectation that the other two cues would elicit approximately a 10 dB increase \nin SPL. \n Participants also produced a monologue for approximately 1 min, 30 s in \nthe COMF and NOISE conditions. To ensure that the participants did not become \nfatigued during the experimental session, the monologue was not completed in \nthe COMF+10 and 2xCOMF conditions. The examiners responded to the participant \nas necessary to maintain the flow of the monologue. For example, the examiners \nnodded their head and made eye contact with the participant. If the participant \npaused for more than a few seconds, the examiners asked a question such as \n\"Can you tell me more about what happened?\", but that was rarely \nnecessary. The role of the examiner was not large enough to truly call the \ninteraction a conversational exchange. \n The COMF condition was always completed before the loud conditions. The \norder of the three loud conditions for the reading task (COMF+10, 2xCOMF, and \nNOISE) was counterbalanced across participants. The monologue task was \ncompleted after the reading task. \n Calibration of the Respiratory Kinematic Signals\n \nBecause LV change reflects the combined effect of changes in RC and AB volumes (\nKonno & Mead, 1967), the sum of the RC and AB signals, corrected for the \nrespective RC and AB contributions to LV change, was computed. Two nonspeech \ntasks, rest breathing and \"speech-like\" breathing, were used to \ndetermine the RC and AB contributions to LV change. Data were collected for two \n45-s periods of rest breathing and three 45-s periods of \"speech-like\"\nbreathing. For the \"speech-like\" breathing, participants were \ninstructed to read the sentence \"You buy Bobby a puppy now if he wants \none\" silently, 1 time per breath. LV data were collected during rest \nbreathing and \"speech-like\" breathing using a spirometer (VacuMed \nUniversal Ventilation Meter). The spirometer used has a very small dead space \nand, therefore, does not cause a change to respiratory patterns due to a \nbuild-up of carbon dioxide. The spirometric (SP) data were digitized along with \nthe RC and AB signals at 2000 Hz. \n Signals from the SP, RC, and AB collected during rest breathing and \n\"speech-like\" breathing were used to determine the correction factors \nfor the RC and AB. The solution for the correction factors (k1 and k2) in the \nfollowing formula was determined using each set of RC, AB, and SP data points \nin the two breathing tasks: \n\n \n \n\nThe Moore\u2013Penrose pseudoinverse function was used in \nMatlab to calculate the solution for the correction factors with the least \nerror. \n The correction factors were verified by visually checking the calculated \nsum signal [k1(RC) + k2(AB)] against the original SP signal for several \nconsecutive \"speech-like\" breathing cycles. An estimated LV signal \nwas then computed for each point during the reading and monologue tasks using \nthe following formula: \n\n \n \n\n Participants also produced maximum capacity tasks (Hoit & Hixon, 1987).\nA minimum of three VC tasks (in addition to the ones used for subject \ninclusion) were completed with the bands in place. The largest of these was \nused to determine lung capacity (VC). A minimum of three maximum AB-in and \nmaximum AB-out maneuvers were completed at EEL (Hoit & Hixon, 1987). The \nlargest AB-in coupled with the largest AB-out maneuver were used to determine \nAB capacity. Measurements during speech production were expressed as a percent \nof capacity so that comparisons could be made across individuals of differing \nsizes. \n Measurements\nSPL. Average SPL was measured \nusing Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2003) across each sentence of the reading \npassage and each breath group in the monologue. A breath group includes \nall of the words spoken on one breath. \n Timing measurements.\n\nNumber of syllables (#SYL) was computed for each breath group. This \nmeasurement provided an indication of utterance length. \n\nSyllables per second (SYL/SEC) was computed by dividing #SYL by the \nduration for each breath group. Duration was measured as the time of speech \nonset to the time of speech offset that was determined while measuring the \ninitiations and terminations in Matlab. This measure reflected speech rate. \n \n Respiratory kinematic measurements. Respiratory kinematic \nmeasurements were made using algorithms written in Matlab (Mathworks). Before \nany measurements were made, the respiratory kinematic signals were low-pass \nfiltered at 40 Hz to remove noise. The microphone signal was displayed with the \nkinematic signals for measurement.\n\nLVI and ABVI were defined by the point where voicing began for each \nutterance, as indicated by the microphone signal. \n\nLVT and ABVT were defined by the point where voicing ended for each \nutterance, as indicated by the microphone signal. \n\nLVE and abdominal volume excursions (ABVE) were calculated as the volume \nat initiation minus the volume at termination. \n \n Once initiation and termination points were chosen, the acoustic signal \nwas played back to ensure no portion of a breath group was cut off in choosing \nthe initiations and terminations. Initiations and terminations from the LV and \nAB signals were measured relative to EEL. EEL was measured from troughs of \nthree steady rest breaths prior to the start of each trial. Initiations, \nterminations, and excursions were expressed as a percent of VC and abdominal \ncapacity (ABC), respectively. \n RC volume measurements were not included because the results were similar \nto those in the LV measurements. This finding was expected because of the close \ncorrelation between LV and RC volume. Abdominal measurements were included to \nprovide information regarding abdominal volume and to infer abdominal muscle \nactivity during speech. \n Statistics\n For each task (reading and monologue), \nmeans were computed for each participant for each condition (COMF, COMF+10, 2x\nCOMF, and NOISE). To address Purpose 1, changes across the conditions, the \ndifferences in the means were assessed in two-factor repeated measures analyses \nof variance (ANOVAs), separately for the tasks, reading and monologue. The \nANOVAs examining condition effects for the two tasks were done separately \nbecause the COMF+10 and 2xCOMF conditions were not completed in the monologue \ntask. The factors were condition (cue) and sex. Sex was included as a factor in \nthe statistical analyses because differences in respiratory kinematics have \nbeen reported in studies using syllable trains and sentences (Huber et al., 2005\n;Huber & Stathopoulos, 2003; Stathopoulos & Sapienza, 1997), and \nstudies of normal respiratory physiology have demonstrated that women have \nlower static recoil pressures than men (Bode, Dosman, Martin, Ghezzo, & \nMacklem, 1976). Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) tests were \ncompleted for all factors and interactions that were significant in the ANOVA. \nThe alpha level for the ANOVAs and the Tukey's HSD tests was set at p  \n.003, on the basis of an alpha adjustment for the 18 ANOVAs completed (.05/18 = \n.003). \n To statistically examine differences between the two tasks (reading and \nmonologue), the means from COMF and NOISE for both tasks were assessed in a \none-factor repeated-measures ANOVA. The factor was task. Tukey's HSD tests were \ncompleted for all factors and interactions that were significant in the ANOVA. \nThe alpha level for the ANOVAs and the Tukey's HSD tests was set at p  \n.006, on the basis of an alpha adjustment for the nine ANOVAs completed (.05/9 \n= .006). \n Intermeasurer reliability was completed on 2 male and 2 female \nparticipants, who were randomly chosen for remeasurement. Reading (504 \nutterances; 14.8% of utterances) and monologue (220 utterances; 15.8%) were \nremeasured. Independentt tests (degree of freedom = 1434) were completed \non the two sets of measurements. Mean differences (MDs) and alpha levels \nfrom thet tests between the two sets of measurements were as follows: \nSPL:MD = 0.10 dB, p = .76; #SYL: MD = 0.17 syllables, p\n = .64; SYL/SEC: MD = 0.03 syllables per second, p = .56; LVI:\nMD = 0.04 %VC, p = .931; LVT: MD = \u20130.03 %VC, p\n = .94; LVE:MD = 0.07 %VC, p = .83; ABVI: MD = \u20130.04 \n%ABC,p = .91; ABVT: MD = 0.02 %ABC, p = .95; ABVE: MD\n = \u20130.06 %ABC, p = .80. The small mean differences and the lack \nof significant differences between the two sets of measurements indicate good \ninterrater reliability. \n Results\n The statistical summary for the \nreading task is inTable 1, and the summary for the monologue task is in Table 2\n.

Mean ABVE was significantly \nlarger in the monologue task than in the reading task. \n Variability\n The pattern of initiating speech at a \nhigher LV, as compared to COMF, was used fairly consistently in the COMF+10 and \nNOISE conditions. In the COMF+10 condition, LVI was higher than in the COMF \ncondition for 68% of the utterances. In the NOISE condition during reading, LVI \nwas higher than in the COMF condition for 70% of the utterances. In the NOISE \ncondition during monologue, LVI was higher than in the COMF condition for 67% \nof the utterances. In the 2xCOMF condition, LVI was higher than in the COMF \ncondition for only 57% of the utterances. \n In contrast, the most consistent abdominal initiation patterns were seen \nin the 2xCOMF condition during reading. In the 2xCOMF condition, ABVI was lower \nthan in the COMF condition for 67% of the utterances. The COMF+10 and NOISE \nconditions during reading demonstrated less consistency. In the COMF+10 \ncondition, ABVI was lower than in the COMF condition for 60% of the utterances. \nSimilarly, in the NOISE condition during reading, ABVI was lower than in the \nCOMF condition for 58% of the utterances. However, the NOISE condition during \nmonologue demonstrated a consistent pattern in the opposite direction; ABVI was \nhigher than in the COMF condition for 70% of the utterances. \n Discussion\n There were two purposes of the \ncurrent study. One was to examine the effect of cueing on respiratory \nkinematics in a connected speech task. Cues did alter respiratory kinematics, \nregardless of the task (reading and monologue). During the COMF+10 and NOISE \nconditions, participants tended to use higher LVI than during the COMF \ncondition. During the 2xCOMF condition, participants tended to use lower ABVI \nthan during the COMF condition. Differences across conditions were more \npronounced in the reading task than in the monologue task. The respiratory \nkinematic patterns used in the different cueing conditions were similar to \nthose demonstrated for sentence tasks, extending the findings from Huber et al. \n(2005) to connected speech. \n The second purpose of the current study was to examine whether the type of \nspeech task affected respiratory kinematics both at comfortable intensity and \nwith background noise present. Respiratory kinematics were similar across \nreading and monologue; however, there were a few differences between reading \nand monologue regardless of condition (COMF and NOISE). The participants \nproduced more syllables per breath group and spoke more slowly in the monologue \ntask than the reading task. These differences in breath group length resulted \nin larger excursions in the monologue task but not lower terminations. \n Differences Among the Three Cues to Increase Loudness\n\n As inHuber et al.'s (2005) study, SPL increased in all of the loud conditions \nby about 10 dB above COMF for both reading and monologue. During reading, the \nNOISE condition elicited a somewhat larger increase over COMF (about 3 dB) than \nthe 2xCOMF condition. \n Because the amount of SPL change across the loud conditions was similar, \nit can be assumed that about the same increase in subglottal pressure was \nrequired across the loud conditions. This assumption is based on the fact that \nprevious studies have shown a linear relationship between subglottal pressure \nand SPL (Finnegan et al., 2000; Tanaka & Gould, 1983; Tang & \nStathopoulos, 1995). However, as with the sentence tasks (Huber et al., 2005), \nthe strategy the individuals used to generate pressure and increased SPL were \ndifferent depending on how the participants were cued to increase SPL. Although \nthe laryngeal system was likely to be involved in the changes in loudness \nacross the three conditions as well, the differences in respiratory kinematics \nclearly indicate that the cues did affect how the respiratory system was used \nto support the need for higher subglottal pressure in the louder speech. These \ndata extend the findings fromHuber et al. (2005) to connected speech. \n Participants significantly increased LVI in the COMF+10 and NOISE \nconditions during reading. This strategy allowed participants to take advantage \nof greater recoil pressures available at higher LV in order to generate higher \npressures for louder speech. Huber et al. (2005) also found significantly \nhigher LVI during the COMF+10 condition but not during the NOISE condition. \n Although the change in LVI was not significant for the NOISE condition in \nthe monologue task, mean LVI did increase (see Figure 3). The variability \naround initiations and terminations was larger in the monologue task than in \nthe reading task, possibly because of a greater variability in the lengths of \nthe utterances in the monologue task (which is a less constrained task than \nreading). The lengths of the utterances in the monologue task were more varied, \nas demonstrated by the greater standard deviation for the number of syllables \nper breath group. This variability around mean LVI may have affected the \nstatistical result. The trend for increased LVI is present in the data from the \nNOISE condition in the monologue task, and the statistic approaches \nsignificance (p = .006). \n The respiratory mechanism used to increase subglottal pressure in the 2x\nCOMF condition was distinctly different from the one used in the COMF+10 and \nNOISE conditions. The lower ABVI in the 2xCOMF condition as compared to COMF \nsuggests that participants primarily used a strategy of generating pressure for \nloud speech by increasing expiratory pressure through abdominal muscle \ncontraction. \n Several differences exist across the three cue sets that might conceivably \nhave contributed to the results. Among the most obvious differences is the type \nof feedback that participants received (COMF+10: quantitative, visual, \nexternal; 2xCOMF: qualitative, auditory, internal; and NOISE: limited, degraded \nauditory feedback). Also the cues might have required allocation of different \namounts of attention to the task. Arguably, either of these differences are \ncandidates to explain the modulations in the results as a function of cue type. \nHowever, apart from the fact that it is not clear how such differences would \ntranslate to the particular patterns seen, this possibility seems unlikely in \nany straightforward way, on the basis of the data. The logic is as follows. \nPotentially, the COMF+10 condition required the most attention, may have \ninduced a greater cognitive load, and provided the most explicit feedback. The \nNOISE condition presumably involved more automatic processing, requiring little \ndirect attention to increasing loudness volitionally, and it provided the least \namount of feedback due to signal degradation. The 2xCOMF condition could be seen\nas intermediate between the other two conditions on the noted parameters. Less \nattention would have been required to speak at twice comfortable loudness than \nto target a specific SPL using an SPL meter, but the change in loudness was not \nautomatic as in the NOISE condition. Also, although feedback was not as \nspecific as in the COMF+10 condition, the auditory feedback was less degraded \nin the 2xCOMF condition than in the NOISE condition. Yet, data from the COMF+10 \nand NOISE conditions are very similar, and data from the 2xCOMF condition are \ndifferent. Thus, there is clearly no linear relationship between these \nhypothetical variables of interest (feedback, attention) and the results. \n A potentially more satisfying explanation for the results has to do with \npossible differences in participants' perceptions of task \n\"difficulty\" across the cueing conditions. As in the other two \nconditions, the participants spoke approximately 10 dB louder in the 2xCOMF \ncondition than in the COMF condition. A 10 dB increase in loudness was expected \nin the 2xCOMF condition because individuals label sounds that increase by 10 dB \nas sounding twice as loud as a reference intensity level (Stevens, 1955). A 10 \ndB increase as a result of the 2xCOMF cue suggests that participants had a \nclear target for how loud they needed to be. However, the speakers did not \nprepare in advance for the required increase in subglottal pressure and begin \nto speak at a higher LV, as they did in the COMF+10 and NOISE conditions. \nSpeaking \"twice as loud as comfortable\" may not have seemed as \ndifficult to participants as targeting 90 dB on the SPL meter (as in the \nCOMF+10 condition) or speaking in loud noise. Therefore, they may not have \nprepared as much for this condition in advance of beginning each utterance. \nStarting at a lower LV in the 2xCOMF condition, but maintaining a similar SPL \nlevel, necessitated the use of more expiratory muscle pressure to generate \nadequate pressure for speech. Clearly, these explanations are speculative at \nthis point. However, the value of the present results is that they demonstrate \nthe presence of a cueing effect, which is important from both clinical and \nresearch perspectives. The effect of cueing suggests that cognitive factors, \nsuch as \"intention\" or goals, do play a role in regulating movement \neven in gestures as biologically fundamental as breathing (e.g., Lee, 1998). \nFurther, they may pave the way for future research specifically designed to \nassess the intervening mechanisms. \n Consistency of Respiratory Strategy Used\n Use of the \nhigher LVI strategy was fairly consistent across subjects and utterances in \nboth the COMF+10 and NOISE conditions. Even though the difference was not \nsignificant during the NOISE condition in the monologue, participants did \nincrease LVI on a consistent basis. Data from Huber et al. (2005) also have \ndemonstrated consistent increases in LVI in the COMF+10 and NOISE conditions. \nParticipants were more consistent inHuber et al.'s (2005) study than in the \ncurrent study. However, a lower consistency in connected speech tasks was \nexpected. The volume at which speech is initiated depends to some extent on the \nvolume of air in the lungs when speech is terminated for the previous utterance \n(Winkworth et al., 1994). The variability in LVI should be higher in reading \nand monologue because the length of the preceding utterance varied, whereas the \nlength was fixed for the sentence tasks. \n The findings regarding the consistency with which the strategy of \nincreasing LVI was used in the current study andHuber et al.'s (2005) study are \nin contrast with the data fromWinkworth and Davis (1997). Winkworth and Davis \n(1997) found that women were not consistent in their use of this strategy when \nspeaking in noise. The difference in consistency between the data from the \ncurrent study in the NOISE condition and Winkworth and Davis (1997) may be \nrelated to how the noise was presented. In Winkworth and Davis's (1997) study, \nthe noise was presented via headphones, rather than in the free-field. The \nheadphones may have interfered more with the speaker's auditory feedback than \nthe noise in the free-field did, increasing the variability of the speaker's \nmovements. On the basis of the data from this study and from Huber et al. (2005)\n, a more natural cue to increase loudness, such as speaking in noise, does not \nelicit more variable respiratory mechanisms. Respiratory patterns are \nconsistent, suggesting global control of the mechanisms used to support \nincreased loudness, even though it is not completely clear what those \nmechanisms are. \n Effects of Condition on Speaking Rate\n In the NOISE \ncondition, it seemed there were two important considerations for speech. Not \nonly did participants increase SPL but they also slowed their speech rate as \ncompared to the COMF condition. Huber et al. (2005) found that speech rate was \nreduced in the NOISE condition and posited that this slower speech rate was \nrelated to the speakers' attempts to improve transmission of the message in \nspite of the background noise. Slower speech rates in noise may improve the \nintelligibility of speech produced in noise (Van Summers, Pisoni, Bernacki, \nPedlow, & Stokes, 1988). Van Summers et al. (1988) presented speech \nproduced in noise and speech produced in quiet to listeners at similar \nsignal-to-noise ratios and found that the speech produced in noise was more \nintelligible than the speech produced in quiet, possibly because of the slower \nspeech rate. \n However, if speech rate was reduced to improve intelligibility, the speech \nrate effect should be present in the current data for both reading and \nmonologue. Although individuals did speak more slowly in the NOISE condition \nwhen reading, speech rate did not change from the COMF condition to the NOISE \ncondition in the monologue task. The lack of change in speech rate in the \nmonologue task was surprising because the Lombard effect has been shown to be \ngreater as communicative demand increases (Lane & Tranel, 1971). The \nmonologue task should have had a greater communicative demand than the reading \ntask because the participants were constructing a novel message. The lack of \nchange in speech rate during the monologue task may be due to the slow rate \nused during the COMF condition for the monologue task. The slow rate used \nduring the monologue task was most likely related to the language formulation \ndemands present for that task (Solomon & Hixon, 1993). Participants may not \nhave needed to further reduce their speech rate in the NOISE condition during \nthe monologue task in order to be intelligible. \n In the current study, participants also spoke more slowly in the COMF+10 \ncondition as compared to the COMF condition. This effect was not present in the \nsentence data ofHuber et al. (2005). The slower rate in the COMF+10 condition \nwas most likely due to how the SPL meter and reading passage were presented to \nparticipants. Participants had to simultaneously watch the SPL meter on a \ntelevision screen and read the passage from a computer screen. Even though the \ntelevision screen showing the SPL meter was positioned next to the computer \nscreen, speakers may have needed to read more slowly because of the need to \nshift their visual focus from the reading passage to the SPL meter. \n Speech Task-Related Differences\n There were several \ndifferences between the reading and monologue tasks in the current study. The \nmonologue task resulted in longer breath groups than the reading task. \nAccording to mean data presented in earlier studies (Hogde & Rochet, 1989; \nHoit & Hixon, 1987; Hoit et al., 1989; Solomon & Hixon, 1993), this \nfinding was not expected. In those studies, the mean length of the breath \ngroups in reading was longer than the mean in conversation/extemporaneous \nspeech. Because the extemporaneous speech task used byHoit and Hixon (1987) and \nHoit et al. (1989) was very similar to the monologue task used in the current \nstudy, the difference between the current study and previous studies may have \nmore to do with the reading task utilized and the length of the sentences in \nthe reading task. Speakers take breaths most often at sentence boundaries when \nreading (Winkworth et al., 1994). If the sentences were longer in the reading \npassage used in the current study than in other studies, participants would \nhave been more likely to use longer breath groups. \n Participants spoke at a slower rate in the monologue task than in the \nreading task, as was demonstrated byHogde and Rochet (1989) and Solomon and \nHixon (1993) as well. Solomon and Hixon (1993) hypothesized that the slower \nspeech rate in monologue is due to the fact that more linguistic formulation is \nrequired in monologue than in reading. \n Both LVE and ABVE were larger in the monologue task than in the reading \ntask in the current study.Hixon et al. (1973) also found larger LVE during loud \nreading. The larger LVE and ABVE in reading in the current study are most \nlikely due to the longer breath groups and slower rate in the monologue task. \nSolomon and Hixon (1993) found that the reading task, which resulted in longer \nbreath groups in their study, was associated with larger ABVE than the \nmonologue task. Additionally,Dromey and Ramig (1998) reported that when they \nasked their participants to speak more slowly, LVE increased. \n Because most of what is known about respiratory function for loud speech \nis based on the production of syllable trains and sentences, it was of interest \nto compare the results in the current study to those from previous studies \nusing syllable trains and sentences (see Table 4). The LV data from the reading \nand monologue tasks are similar to findings for sentences and syllable trains. \nSimilarly, the abdominal data in the current study are comparable across tasks. \n\n \n View this table:\n[in this window] \n[in \na new window] \n\n\u00a0  Table 4 Comparison across studies of \nrespiratory kinematics with increased loudness.\n  \n\n One consistent difference between the connected speech \ntasks and the sentence and syllable train tasks is that LVE and ABVE both \nincreased with increased loudness, regardless of cue, in the reading task. LVE \nalso increased significantly in NOISE in the monologue task, and the trend for \na larger ABVE in NOISE is present in the monologue data as well. The changes in \nLVE and ABVE are less consistent in the syllable train and sentence tasks (see \nTable 4). The consistent increase in excursions with increased loudness in the \nconnected speech tasks may be related to utterance length. As utterance length \nincreases, increasing loudness may tax the respiratory system more, requiring \nlarger excursions. Because the sentence and syllable train tasks are shorter \n(12 syllables or less) than the average breath group in the connected speech \ntasks, they may not be long enough to really tax the respiratory system at \nhigher intensities. \n The findings, both similarities and differences in respiratory kinematics, \nacross speech tasks are an important finding for several reasons. First, these \nfindings suggest that the cognitive mechanisms (such as the perceived \ndifficulty of reaching the target loudness) and utterance length may be the \nprimary determinants in neural control of respiratory movements. The overarching\nspeech task (whether the person is planning to say one utterance or several in \na row) may not be as important for neural control and planning. This hypothesis \nwould make sense from the standpoint of natural speech production. Often when \nconversing with another individual, we do not know how many utterances we will \nbe producing, although we know the message we are trying to convey. This \nhypothesis would be further bolstered if future studies demonstrate that \nrespiratory kinematics for longer sentence tasks are more similar to kinematics \nfor utterances from the connected speech tasks. Second, from a technical \nstandpoint, sentence tasks are much easier to collect and analyze, especially \nwhen examining multiple speech subsystems and when collecting data from \nclinical populations. \n In summary, respiratory kinematic patterns differed depending on the cue \nused to elicit louder speech. This finding extends the results of Huber et al. \n(2005) to connected speech and provides support for the hypothesis that \n\"intention\" or goals play a role in the control of respiratory \nkinematic movements. These data indicate that cue must be considered when \ncollecting data for research studies or in clinical situations. Further, \nrespiratory strategies for supporting loud speech were similar between the \nreading and monologue tasks and between the connected speech tasks and previous \ndata on syllable trains and sentence productions when the same cue was used. \nHowever, there were differences present among the tasks that were associated \nwith differences in utterance length and speech rate. These results suggest that\nrespiration for speech may be more impacted by the length of the utterance, the \ntarget loudness of the utterance, and the rate of speech than by length of the \nspeaking task (i.e., 1\u20132 utterances vs. many utterances produced \nconsecutively). \n \n  Appendix \nTop\nAbstract\nAppendix\nReferences\n \n \u00a0 \nReading passage. \n \n\"The Papa Passage\" \n (Sapienza & Stathopoulos, 1995) \n Papa was a great man.

Not taking medication or changing your regimen without consulting \nyour doctor can lead to ineffective treatment and in some cases even visual \nloss. It is crucial to follow the medical routine prescribed by one's physician.\n \n\n Opening the eyedropper: make sure your hands are washed before handling \nyour eye drops. Your fingers must never touch the tip of the eyedropper during \nopening and closing the dropper as this may contaminate the eye drops. \n\nIt is important to tell your doctor of medications that you are or have \nbeen allergic to. \n\nMake sure you know the name of the medication and how often you need to \ntake it. \n\nTaking multiple drops at the same time reduces effectiveness. Wait 15 \nminutes between drops. \n\nDo not increase the number or amount of medication taken at one time - \n\" If some is good, more must be better\" does not hold true. \n\nIf possible, keep eye drops in the refrigerator. When cold, it is easier to \ntell if drops have gotten into the eye. Eye drops that require to be kept cold \nmay lose their potency if left outside. Always replace the cap after using the \ndrops. \n\nDo not stop taking medication just because you have no obvious symptoms.\n \nTake all prescribed doses at the prescribed time. Missed doses reduce the \neffectiveness of treatment. \n\nRemember to take medications with you when you travel. \n\nBefore instilling the drops, check which eye they are meant for (e.g., left \neye instead of right eye) and check the label for the right drops, expiry date \nor tampered seals. If the eye drops are milky, do not forget to shake well \nbefore use. \n\nLearn how to take eye drops properly - tilt the head back; pull the lower \nlid down with the index finger; look up when putting in the drops. This will \nstop you from blinking, and keep the medicine from draining out of your eye too \nquickly. To prevent contaminating the eye dropper tip, be careful not to let \nthe tip touch your eye, eyelid, eyelashes or fingers; do not blink repeatedly \nafter instilling the eye drops; instead shut the eyes gently and press one \nfinger against the lower lid where it meets your nose for at least 2 minutes - \nthis slows down the absorption of eye drops into the blood stream. Use a tissue \nto blot around the eyes, but do not rub. \n\nMaintain a medication schedule and lists of treatments of doctors. \n\nIf uncomfortable symptoms occur when using eye drops, discuss the problem \nwith your ophthalmologist. \n\nPrescription eye drops such as steroids are extremely potent. Using them \nwithout the knowledge of your eye doctor for a problem that seems similar to an \nearlier problem is dangerous. Prolonged or indiscriminate use of steroids can \ncause cataract and/or glaucoma, leading to decreased vision. \n\n\nListed are some risk factors for eye diseases \n\n Smoking - increases the risk of cataract and macular degeneration by more \nthan 3 times \n\n Alcohol -  More than 1 alcoholic drink per day can increase cataract risk. \n \n\n Bright UV light / not using sunglasses -  increases the risk of cataract \nand macular degeneration. \n\n Blood pressure and cholesterol -  increases the risk of macular \ndegeneration. \n\n Lack of protective eyewear -  risk of eye injury and loss of sight.\n \nTIMING OF EYE AND VISION SCREENING EXAMINATIONS \n\n Vision screening and eye examination are vital for the detection of \nconditions that distort or suppress the normal visual image, which may lead to \ninadequate school performance or, even worse, blindness in children. Retinal \nabnormalities, cataracts, glaucoma, retinoblastoma [eye tumour], eye muscle \nimbalances, and systemic disease with ocular manifestations may all be \nidentified by careful examination. Examination of the eyes can be performed at \nany age, beginning in the newborn period, and should be done at all well-baby \nclinics. Vision screening should be performed for a child at the earliest age \nthat is practical, because a small child rarely complains that one eye is not \nseeing properly. Conditions that interfere with vision are of extreme \nimportance, because visual stimuli are critical to the development of normal \nvision. Normal visual development requires the brain to receive equally clear, \nfocused images from both eyes simultaneously for the visual pathways to develop \nproperly. \n\n All infants should be examined by 6 months of age to evaluate fixation \npreference, ocular alignment, and the presence of any eye disease. These \ninfants should continue to be checked until 3 or 4 years of age. Formal vision \nscreening evaluations should begin at 3 years of age. \n\n We would like the parents' observations about \"Does your child seem \nto see well?\" \"Does your child hold objects unusually close to his or \nher face when trying to focus?\" \"Do the eyes appear straight?\" \n\"Do the eyes seem to cross?\" It is important because parents' \nobservations often prove correct. Please offer correct family history regarding \neye disorders or early use of glasses. \n\n An examination would include an external inspection of the eyes, tests for \nvisual acuity on an age-appropriate basis, tests for ocular muscle movement and \neye muscle imbalances and ophthalmoscopic examination. \n\n Your child should be comfortable and in good health at the time of the \nexamination and, if at all possible, should have some preparation for the \ntesting situation. Particularly for younger children, you may be required to \ndemonstrate the anticipated testing procedures. It is often convenient for the \nyounger child to sit on the parent's lap during the procedures. \n\n Children who have eyeglasses generally should have their vision tested \nwhile wearing the eyeglasses. Do not forget to bring the child's eyeglasses.\n \nMuscle imbalance testing \nThe assessment of ocular alignment in the preschool and early school-aged \nchild is of considerable importance. The development of ocular muscle imbalance \nmay occur at any age in children and may represent not only simple strabismus \n[squint] but also serious ocular or neurological disease. \n\n\nRefractive errors \nRefractive errors requiring the use of eyeglasses exist in nearly one-fifth \nof children before the late teenage years. The most common clinically \nsignificant refractive error is myopia (nearsightedness), usually seen in \nschool-aged children and correctable with eyeglasses. Hyperopia \n(farsightedness) can cause problems in performing close work but usually does \nnot necessitate correction in children unless it is sufficient to cause crossed \neyes or reduced vision. Astigmatism (unequal curvature of the refractive \nsurfaces of the eye) necessitates corrective eyeglasses if it causes \nsignificantly decreased vision or is of such severity to contribute to the \ndevelopment of amblyopia (lazy eye). In addition, unequal amounts of refractive \nerror between the two eyes (anisometropia) also may lead to amblyopia and may \nrequire a prescription for corrective eyeglasses. The detection of amblyopia at \nan early age is an important aspect of the routine eye examination in the \npediatric population. Left undetected and untreated, amblyopia may lead to \nirreversible visual deficit. \n\nWe hope this information has been useful to you, and we look forward to \nkeeping in touch with you in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEye Care Center, Eye Clinics, Eye Care\n| Eye Disorders | Eye Care | Laboratory Services | The Lasik Centre | \nPatient Services | Diabetic Retinopathy | Age-Related Macular Degeneration | \n | Presbyopia | Glaucoma Treatment | Anterior Uveitis | Lasik Eye Surgery | \nContact Lens | Cataract Surgery | Anterior Uveitis | Crossed Eyes | \n | Dry \nEye | Computer vision syndrome | Flashes & Floaters | Stye | Pupillary \nDilatation | Test Conducted | Executive Health Check |\n | Research & \nInnovation | Contribution & Donations | Facilities | Quality Policy | \nContact Us | Our Doctors | About Us | \u00a0Link Us | \nCopyright \u00a9 Shroff Eye Hospital, Mumbai, India \n\n"}

the project was continuation of the development of new \nchlor-alkali electrochemical reactors (ECRs) that employ oxygen-depolarized \ncathodes. Due to their lower operating voltages, the oxygen-depolarized \nreactors consume up to 30% less electrical energy per unit weight of the \nproducts (chlorine and caustic soda), than the state-of-the-art membrane \nelectrolyzers with hydrogen-evolving cathodes.\nThe existing chlor-alkali membrane cells could not be simply retrofitted to \naccommodate the oxygen-depolarized electrodes due to the different principles \nand conditions of operation of the oxygen-depolarized cathodes and \nhydrogen-evolving cathodes. A completely new design of the oxygen-depolarized \nelectrolyzer and optimization of the conditions of electrolysis were required \nin order to achieve satisfactory cell performance that would match or exceed \nthat commonly attained in the state-of-the-art membrane cells with \nhydrogen-evolving cathodes. The zero-gap design of chlor-alkali cells developed \nat LANL was based on the fuel cells, where the cathode and the anode remain in \nintimate contact with the ion-exchange membrane.\nSince the performance of any individual cell component can influence the \nperformance of other components, the experimental effort focused not only on \nthe oxygen cathode, but also on the anode, the membrane, the cell hardware, and \nthe operating conditions. The vital performance characteristics which were \nmonitored included the overall cell voltage, high frequency membrane \nresistance, caustic current efficiency, and composition of the caustic product. \nOur major accomplishments include:\n\nElucidation of the mechanism of the unwanted peroxide generation\nDevelopment of the method to eliminate peroxide\nIncreasing the caustic current efficiency to match current industrial \nstandards for membrane cells\nElimination of the corrosion of the cathode hardware\nEvaluation of the ion exchange membranes \nAlthough many problems associated with optimization of the technology were \nsolved, some issues require additional work. Corrosion of the cathodes \nemploying carbon supported platinum catalyst seems to be the major drawback of \nthe current cell design. While the extent of corrosion can be significantly \nreduced by using cathode protection techniques, the technology would greatly \nbenefit if the cathode was completely corrosion resistant. Consequently, any \nfuture effort should focus on developing the corrosion resistant cathode. Based \non the current knowledge, the corrosion resistant cathode should involve a \ncarbon supported metal catalyst, which would be less noble than platinum. Metal \nalloys or elemental silver are most promising choices for the catalyst. Another \npossible way to eliminate cathode corrosion may involve alternative supports \nfor the catalyst. However, this path may be more effort intensive and less \nlikely to produce the desired effect without creating other problems. On the \ncontrary, all the technical improvements made so far are believed to be \noperational with the corrosion resistant cathode employing a carbon supported \nmetal catalyst.\n2. Introduction\nTotal US production of chlorine reached the level of 13.0 million tons in \n2003, while the corresponding caustic soda production approached 14.7 million \ntons. Approximately 70% of chlorine and caustic produced in the US is \nmanufactured by the diaphragm technology, 12% by the mercury technology and 18% \nby the modern membrane technology. The mercury process is the most energy \nintensive and consumes around 3700 kWh of electricity per metric ton of \nchlorine. The corresponding numbers for the diaphragm and membrane technologies \nare 2900 kWh/t and 2500 kWh/t, respectively. Overall, the chlor-alkali \nelectrolysis is one of the most energy intensive industrial operations. It \nconsumes approximately 10 GW (equivalent to 317 trillion BTU/yr or 87600 \nGWh/yr) of electrical energy, which corresponds to around 2% of the total \nelectric power generated in the United States. Attempts to reduce manufacturing \ncosts of chlorine have recently led to modifications of the conventional \nmembrane electrolyzers that allow for operation at around 50% higher throughput \n(0.6 A/cm2) than the standard cells. While these modifications lower the \ncapital and maintenance costs, they result in higher cell voltages and \nconsequently in higher energy consumption. As the energy consumption per unit \nweight of the products is directly proportional to the electrochemical reactor \ncell voltage, lowering of the cell voltage is the only route to energy savings.\n\nOver the last several years, membrane technology has been optimized to the \nextent that no viable reduction of the cell voltage is expected from further \ncell modifications. However, by replacing the hydrogen-evolving cathodes in the \nmembrane chlor-alkali cells by oxygen-depolarized cathodes, the cell voltages \nand corresponding power consumption could be reduced by as much as 30% (Fig. 1).\n \nFigure 1. 30% lowering in cell voltage and, hence, 30% \nlowering in energy consumption per unit weight of the products is achieved in \nchlor-alkali cells by replacing the hydrogen-evolving cathode by an \noxygen-consuming cathode. \nFigure 1 explains schematically the relationship between the ordinary \nmembrane chlor-alkali ECRs (left) and the modified chlor-alkali ECR employing \nan oxygen cathode. Electric energy savings that could be achieved by \nimplementing this modification in chlor-alkali ECRs are very significant. At a \ncurrent density of 0.30 to 0.45 A/cm2, typically used by the industry, \nreplacement of the hydrogen-evolving cathode by an oxygen-reducing cathode has \nbeen clearly shown by us to date to save around 1.0 V out of the 3.1 V to 3.3 V \nrequired for operation of conventional chlor-alkali ECRs. Since the electric \npower (energy) consumed per unit weight of product is directly proportional to \nthe cell voltage, the reduction in the cell voltage at a constant current \ndensity amounts to savings of 30% in the electrolysis energy. The energy \nsavings would be even more substantial if all the chlor-alkali plants switched \nto oxygen-fed membrane reactors. They can reach as much as 40%. Therefore, \nintroduction of the energy saving, oxygen-depolarized reactors would amount up \nto a 0.8% cut in the overall US electric power consumption. It would also \namount to a 0.8% cut in total US CO2 emissions associated with generation of \nelectric power.\nWhen the research described in this report was awarded funding, the \nhydrogen generated by the industry was quite commonly considered a low-value \nbyproduct and many chlor-alkali plants were venting it to the atmosphere. \nToday, the Government recognizes hydrogen as a fuel of the future and funds the \nresearch aimed at both developing new technologies that would utilize hydrogen \nrather than the conventional fuels and finding efficient and safe ways of \nhydrogen storage. Quite recently, Dow Chemical installed the hydrogen/air fuel \ncell stacks supplied by General Motors to capture part of the energy stored in \nhydrogen generated by the Dow\u2019s chlor-alkali plant in Freeport, Texas. \nWhile equipping the existing chlor-alkali plants with the hydrogen \n\u201cburning\u201d fuel cells seems feasible, it will never offer comparable \nenergy and environmental benefits as the chlor-alkali technology utilizing \noxygen-depolarized cathodes. First of all, the fuel cells can return only \naround 50% of the clean hydrogen energy, whereas much more of the \n\u201cdirty\u201d fossil fuel energy is consumed to generate the hydrogen. From \nthe economic perspective, installation of the fuel cell stacks translates into \nyet another capital investment, in addition to the investment associated with \nconstructing and equipping the chlor-alkali cell room.\nConsequently, it is our belief that the economic and the \nenergy/environmental factors are in favor of the technology that utilizes \noxygen-depolarized cells and that this technology will eventually replace the \ncurrent chlorine/caustic manufacturing methods.\n3. Background\nAll three chlor-alkali technologies, which are currently in use, have \nadvantages and disadvantages. The most frequently employed diaphragm technology \nuses very inexpensive cells, but it produces relatively dilute and impure NaOH. \nConsequently, significant use of steam is required to concentrate the hydroxide \nsolution before it can be shipped to the point of use. Moreover, many diaphragm \ncells still utilize asbestos-based diaphragms, which raises environmental and \nhealth concerns.\nThe mercury technology produces highly concentrated, 50% hydroxide of the \nhighest purity. In this case, no concentration steps are required. However, the \nelectrolysis itself is very energy intensive. In addition, the mercury \nemissions from the process raise very serious environmental concerns. This \nmethod will soon be phased out.\nThe membrane technology produces high purity hydroxide and requires less \nsteam to concentrate the NaOH solution than the diaphragm method. It is \ncurrently the cleanest and most energy efficient chlor-alkali technology. \nHowever, the membrane cells are relatively expensive, mainly due to the high \ncost of the specialized bi-layer ion exchange membranes that they employ. \nNonetheless, this method completely dominates the chlor-alkali industry in \nJapan, where the energy prices are higher and the environmental regulations \nstricter than in the United States.\nThe attractiveness of the membrane technology with oxygen-depolarized \ncathodes versus the existing technologies relies on the substantial energy \nsavings and the associated environmental benefits that this technology offers.\n\nDespite how simple it sounds, replacement of the hydrogen-evolving cathode \nin a membrane cell requires significant changes in the cell design and \nmaterials as well as in the cell operating conditions. The key element of the \noxygen-depolarized cell is the oxygen cathode of the gas diffusion type. The \nelectrode has to be designed to facilitate formation of the three-phase \nboundaries (gas/liquid/solid) that involve oxygen, water/caustic soda solution, \nand the catalyst particles. Moreover, it has to effectively manage transport of \noxygen to and caustic soda from the catalyst layer. Although gas diffusion \nelectrodes (GDEs) have been quite extensively used in fuel cells and optimized \nfor this application, the conditions encountered in the cathode compartment of \na chlor-alkali electrolyzer are quite different. High viscosity of the \nconcentrated NaOH and its strongly corrosive properties may have a negative \ninfluence on both formation of the three-phase boundaries in the electrode \npores and transport of the reagents and products to and from the reaction site. \nIn the worst case scenario, the electrode pores may get completely flooded with \nthe NaOH solution and the cathode, where the hydrogen evolution takes place, \nwill operate at much lower potential.\nThe presence of oxygen and significantly higher potential of the \noxygen-depolarized cathode as compared to the hydrogen-evolving cathode can \nresult in corrosion of the cathode hardware and other components in the cathode \ncompartment, which would not be observed in the standard membrane cell thanks \nto the cathodic protection and reducing properties of hydrogen.\nAnother difference of practical importance between the hydrogen-evolving \ncells and oxygen-depolarized cells is the relative stability of the \nintermediate products of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen \nreduction reaction (ORR). The HER does not generate any stable intermediates:\n \n \nPrecipitation of sodium peroxide (eq. 4) can cause liquid and gas flow \nmaintenance problems, block the electrode active surface area and even destroy \nthe microporous structure of the gas diffusion electrode.\nTo our knowledge, there are no industrial-scale chlor-alkali plants \nequipped with oxygen-depolarized cells. However, there do exist pilot-scale \nplants in Japan and Europe that utilize oxygen-depolarized cells for the \nchlor-alkali electrolysis as well as for the similar process of HCl \ndestruction. The technical details of these cells are not well known, but the \nfinite-gap design seems to be the most prevalent. In cells of this type, the \ngas diffusion electrode acts as a separator of the oxygen and caustic chambers. \nThe advantage of such a design is that the whole surface area of the \nion-exchange membrane remains in contact with NaOH solution of the optimum \nconcentration at all times, which guarantees the best overall membrane \nperformance. However, the design also has serious drawbacks. The layer of NaOH \nbetween the electrode and the membrane contributes unfavorably to the overall \ncell resistance. In addition, as the hydrostatic pressure of the NaOH solution \nchanges along the electrode height, maintaining the uniform distribution and \nidentical properties of the three-phase boundaries and preventing the electrode \nflooding may pose problems.\nIn order to avoid the problems typical for the finite gap / three \ncompartment electrolyzers, we have chosen the so-called zero-gap design, \nadapted from the fuel cell technology. In the zero-gap cell, the cathode \nremains in intimate contact with the ion-exchange membrane. Oxygen is fed to \nand caustic collected from the common cathode compartment. Different \nmodifications of the zero-gap design, which were used throughout this research, \nare described in more detail in the technical part of the report. The project \nwas a continuation of our earlier work on oxygen-depolarized chlor-alkali \ncells. It addressed the issues, which were previously identified as critical \nfor making the oxygen-depolarized membrane cells match the current performance \nstandards for the state-of-the-art hydrogen-evolving membrane cells. Among \nthese issues were caustic purity, current efficiency, corrosion protection, etc.\n\nThe principal investigator is a member of the fuel cell team in Materials \nScience and Technology Division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and \ntogether with Dr. Ludwig Lipp participated in the previous research on \noxygen-depolarized chlor-alkali cells, which was directed by Dr. Shimshon \nGottesfeld.\n4. Technical Part\n4.1 Critical Review of the Literature\nThe first attempts to develop chlor-alkali technology utilizing the air \ncathode date back to the early eighties. The laboratory scale cells developed \nby ELTECH Systems were operated for more than 350 days on scrubbed air at 0.3 \nA/cm2, but the test with commercial size cells was terminated after 105 days \ndue to the durability problem of the air cathode [1,2]. Even though eventually \nabandoned, these early experiments demonstrated that significant energy savings \ncan be achieved by replacing the hydrogen electrode in the membrane cell with \nan oxygen electrode. Research aimed at implementing the oxygen cathodes in \nchlor-alkali membrane cells has been especially intensive in the last 11-12 \nyears and seems to be most advanced in Japan and Europe, where energy prices \nare higher and environmental policies stricter than in the United States. \nHowever, only a very limited amount of the published material covers the \nresearch done so far. One of the factors responsible for this situation is the \nproprietary nature of the results generated. Another factor results from the \nrequirement of a stable cell performance for extended periods of time, \ncomparable to that typical for the state-of-the-art membrane cells. While the \nlong term cell performance may sometimes be predicted from the short time cell \nbehavior, the only method that guarantees the correct determination of the \nperformance durability is that based on operating the cell for as long as \npossible, which sometimes translates into running a single test for several \nmonths or even years. In order to achieve satisfactory cell performance, the \noxygen diffusion cathode has to meet the following requirements:\n\nEfficient transport of oxygen and water to and NaOH from the reaction \nlayer,\nEfficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction according to eq. 2\n\nEfficient formation of the three phase boundaries involving oxygen, water \n(NaOH solution), and the catalyst \nThe transport of reagents to and products from the reaction layer is \naccomplished in two different ways. In the more frequently used, \nthree-compartment or finite-gap cells [1-10], the oxygen cathode separates the \ncathode chamber into the oxygen and the NaOH compartments. The cathodes used in \nsuch cells are sometimes called gas-liquid-impermeable electrodes [11]. In a \ncell of this type, the gap between the electrode and the membrane is fed with a \nmore dilute NaOH solution than the final product of the electrolysis. The feed \nmixes with the significantly more concentrated NaOH product. The concentration \nof the final NaOH product is maintained at around 32%, which guarantees the \noptimum membrane hydration and performance. In the zero-gap cells, the gas \ndiffusion electrode remains in intimate contact with the ion exchange membrane. \nThe oxygen and water enter the electrode from the gas diffusion layer side. \nElectrodes of this type are called gas-liquid-permeable electrodes and have \nbeen used by Permelec Electrode in Japan [11,12] and also at LANL\nBoth ways of transporting the reagents and products have advantages and \ndisadvantages. The layer of NaOH solution between the electrode and the \nmembrane in a three-compartment/finite-gap cell creates favorable conditions \nfor optimum membrane performance, but it also contributes to the increased cell \nvoltage. Moreover, it produces the height dependent differential pressure \nbetween the catholyte gap and oxygen across the cathode, which may lead to \nuneven gas/liquid separation inside the electrode, electrode flooding and \ncaustic leakage into the oxygen/air compartment. Solving this problem requires \na pressure compensation system, such as that based on oxygen supply via gas \npockets [13-15]. The cathodes in zero-gap cells are less susceptible to \nflooding due to the lack of liquid volume between the electrode and the \nmembrane, but maintaining the proper membrane hydration is more difficult than \nin the three-compartment/finite-gap cells due to the effects of the electrode \nand the membrane boundary layers [16].\nWhile the variety of materials were studied as catalysts of the oxygen \nreduction in alkaline media [17-30], only carbon supported platinum (Pt/C) \n[3-5,9] and carbon supported silver (Ag/C) [4-9,11] have been used so far in \neither the laboratory-scale or pilot-scale chlor-alkali cells employing the \noxygen cathodes. As expected, the platinum-based catalysts offer the highest \nrates of oxygen reduction. However, the electrocatalytic activity of silver is \nnot negligible compared to that of platinum under the industrial conditions \n[31]. In fact, quite comparable cell voltages were observed for the cells \nloaded with 0.56 mg/cm2 of platinum and 2.63 mg/cm2 of silver by Furuya and \nAikawa [5] and the performance of the Ag-loaded cells could possibly be \nimproved if the catalyst particle size could be reduced [5]. Quite recently, \nmixed Pt/Ag catalysts have been studied and the catalyst containing 93% (atom) \nof silver was found to be as active as pure platinum [32]. Moreover, this \ncatalyst did not deteriorate when the cell was shunted and the cathode \ncompartment was not flushed with an inert gas. These conditions are known to \ncause significant losses of carbon supported Pt catalysts due to the direct \ndissolution of Pt and the oxidative corrosion of carbon carriers [3]. Both \nphenomena also occur during the cell operation, but their magnitude decreases \nsignificantly with the increase in current density [3].\nDue to the strongly corrosive properties of the oxygen saturated, \nconcentrated caustic, the chlor-alkali cells employing oxygen-depolarized \ncathodes are more susceptible to performance losses than the standard \nhydrogen-evolving cells. It was shown that prolonged cell operation lead to \ncatalyst loss [3], changes in the cathode morphology [10,33], increased wetting \nof the gas diffusion layer [4] or even flooding of the cathode [9]. It was \nsuggested [4,33] that one of the factors responsible for cathode degradation \nwas generation of peroxide (eq. 3). However, no quantitative correlation \nbetween peroxide generation and performance losses was demonstrated.\n4.2 Experimental\n4.2.1 Cells\nThe cells used in this study employed either separate gas diffusion \ncathodes (Figs. 2 and 3) or so-called membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) \n(Fig.4). \nFigure 2. Components of the oxygen-depolarized cell \nwith the separate gas diffusion cathode and metal cathode hardware: 1 \u2013 \ncathode current collector, 2 \u2013 Teflon gasket, 3 \u2013 cathode flow-field, \n4 \u2013 gas diffusion cathode, 5 \u2013 hydrophilic spacer (if equipped), 6 \n\u2013 ion exchange membrane, 7 - DSA\u00ae coated anode meshes, 8 \u2013 Teflon \ngasket, 9 \u2013 integrated DSA\u00ae coated anode flow-field/current collector.\n \nThe separate gas diffusion electrodes were either commercially available \n(ELAT\u00ae from E-TEK, Inc.) or homemade. The catalyst layer of the commercial \nelectrodes contained either 80% or 20% of carbon-supported (Vulcan XC-72) \nplatinum with a total Pt loading of 5.0 and 0.5 mg/cm2, respectively. The \nhomemade electrodes also utilized a carbon-supported platinum catalyst (E-TEK). \nUnless otherwise stated, the geometric surface area of the electrodes was 50 cm2\n. The cathodes in some cells were separated from the membrane by a thin \nhydrophilic spacer (Panex\u00ae 30 carbon cloth, Zoltek) (Fig. 2). \nFigure 3. Components of the oxygen-depolarized cell with the graphite \ncathode hardware: 1 \u2013 integrated graphite cathode flow-field/current \ncollector, 2 \u2013 Teflon gasket, 3 \u2013 gas diffusion electrode, 4 \u2013 \nion exchange membrane, 5 - DSA\u00ae coated anode meshes, 6 \u2013 Teflon \ngasket, 7 \u2013 integrated DSA\u00ae coated anode flow-field/current collector.\n \nThe membrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs) were prepared using standard \nmethods developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The cathode side of the \nbi-layer membrane was painted with a known amount of the solution containing \nunsupported precious metal catalyst, Nafion\u00ae binder solution, deionized \nwater and isopropanol. Geometric surface area of the catalyst layer in the MEA \nwas 50 cm2 and the catalyst loading was 5.0 mg/cm2. In order to ensure \nefficient transport of the reagents and products between the catalyst layer and \nthe flow-field, the cells utilizing MEAs were equipped with separate gas \ndiffusion layers that remained in intimate contact with the catalyst layer \n(Fig.4). The gas diffusion layers (GDLs) applied included the low temperature \nsingle-sided LT 1400-W and double-sided LT 2500-W from E-TEK as well as 60% \nteflonized Toray\u00ae paper. \nFigure 4. Components of the \noxygen-depolarized cell equipped with the membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) \ntype gas diffusion cathode: 1 \u2013 cathode current collector, 2 \u2013 Teflon \ngasket, 3 \u2013 cathode flow-field, 4 \u2013 gas diffusion layer, 5 \u2013 \nmembrane-electrode-assembly (MEA), 6 - DSA\u00ae coated anode meshes, 7 \u2013 \nTeflon gasket, 8 \u2013 integrated DSA\u00ae coated anode flow-field/current \ncollector. \nThe LANL proprietary patterned metal flow-field was made of either \nstainless steel (SS316) or nickel. The stainless steel flow-field was \ngold-plated and the nickel flow-field was either gold- or silver-plated.\nUnless otherwise stated, the anode consisted of DSA\u00ae coated titanium \nmeshes (mesh 120 and 60). An integrated single serpentine channel anode \nflow-field and current collector were made of DSA\u00ae coated titanium. The \ncell gaskets were either custom manufactured TriguardTM gaskets (W.L.Gore, \nInc.) or homemade using ~ 1 mm or ~1.6 mm Gore-Tex\u00ae Teflon tape (W.L.Gore, \nInc.).\nThe cells were sandwiched between two metal endplates (not shown in Figures \n2-4) of a larger size. The cathode endplate was made of stainless steel and the \nanode endplate was made of titanium. The endplates were designed to accommodate \ncartridge heaters and thermocouples for precise cell temperature control. Their \nrelatively large size was essential for minimizing cell temperature \nfluctuations. The endplates also provided means for: (i) connecting the feed \nlines, exhaust lines (see section 4.2.2 and Figure 5) and power cables to the \ncell, and, (ii) fastening the cell elements and maintaining reproducible \nconditions at the membrane/electrode/flow-field boundaries. The last task was \naccomplished with the help of eight bolts, which were symmetrically placed near \nthe edges of the endplates. The cell bolts were torqued to a preset torque that \nresulted in an average membrane compression of 689 kPa (100 psi), as determined \nin separate experiments with Pressurex\u00ae pressure sensitive film.\nFive different membranes were used in the experiments. Four of them, \nhereafter called membrane 1, membrane 2, etc., were specialized chlor-alkali \nbi-layer membranes. The fifth one was BPSH-30, a homemade membrane originally \ndesigned for direct methanol fuel cells. The membranes used in the cells with \nseparate gas diffusion cathodes (Figures 2 and 3) were soaked in either 2% NaOH \nsolution (membrane 1) for an hour or dilute (pH=12) NaOH solution (membranes 2 \nthrough 4, and BPSH-30) for a few hours before use. As dry membranes (membranes \n2 through 4) expanded from 8% to 10% upon the soaking, they were cut to size \nonce fully swelled. Since membrane 1 was stored in hydrated state and it was \nprecut before the soaking. All the membranes were kept wet during the \ninstallation. Unless otherwise stated, the results were obtained with membrane \n1.\nThe MEAs were prepared using membrane 2 and installed in the cell without \npresoaking to prevent flaking off of the catalyst layer as a result of membrane \nexpansion. Once the cell was assembled and placed in the test station, both the \nanode and cathode compartments were filled with a dilute NaOH solution (pH=12) \nand soaked for a few hours. The expansion of the MEA under such conditions was \nrestricted by the GDL and the flow-field on the cathode side and by the \ntitanium meshes on the anode side. When this procedure was applied, no \ndelamination of the membrane and the catalyst layer occurred.\n4.2.2. Experimental setup and conditions\nFigure 5 below presents the schematic diagram of the reagent/product \ndelivery/collection system for the two test stations used throughout the \nstudies. The cells were operated at 90oC. Unless otherwise stated, the cathode \nchamber was fed with oxygen at 239 kPa (20 psig) at a flow rate corresponding \nto five times that required by stoichiometry of the four-electron oxygen \nreduction at the applied current density (eq. 2). The oxygen stream was \nhumidified with 0.5 cm3/min of deionized water. The pressure in the cathode \ncompartment was controlled by a backpressure regulator (Fig. 5), which was fed \nwith nitrogen. The nitrogen feed line (not shown in Fig. 5) was equipped with a \nbleeding valve, which enabled simultaneous operation of two cells at different \npressures.\nThe anode compartment was not pressurized. The used brine and chlorine from \nthe anode chamber were separated in a recirculation tank (Fig. 5). The tank was \nequipped with an overflow and constantly fed with fresh purified brine (310 \ng/dm3, < 10 ppb Ca + Mg) supplied by either Dow Chemical (Freeport, TX) or \nTexas Brine Company (Sugarland, TX). Fresh and used brine were mixed thoroughly \nin the tank and part of the resulting solution was redirected to the cell while \nanother part was collected for recycling. In this way, constant concentration \nof the feed solution was maintained. Unless otherwise stated, the feed \nconcentration was 200 \u00b1 3 g/dm3. The estimated outlet brine \nconcentration was approximately 186 g/dm3 at 1.0 A/cm2 and proportionally \nhigher at lower current densities. The chlorine gas was scrubbed with 18-20% \nNaOH solution.\nThe strongly corrosive environment in the cathode compartment may promote \ncorrosion of the cathode and its hardware when the electrical circuit is open, \nespecially as a result of a power outage during unattended cell operation. In \norder to minimize corrosion, the cathode gas feed line was equipped with two \nsolenoid valves that would immediately stop the oxygen flow and replace it with \nnitrogen upon a power loss (Fig. 5). In order to prevent restoring of the \noxygen flow upon the power return, when the electrolysis could not be \nautomatically restarted, the valves were energized through an electric relay \nthat required manual resetting after the power outage. \nFigure \n5. Diagram of the reagent/product delivery/collection system. \n4.2.3. Analytical procedures\nThe peroxide content in the NaOH solution was determined \nspectrophotometrically. Fresh samples of sodium hydroxide were mixed with a \nknown amount of potassium ferricyanide solution in aqueous NaOH. The peroxide \ncontent was determined from a decrease of ferricyanide absorption at 418 nm \n[34].\nCaustic current efficiency was determined from titration of the sodium \nhydroxide samples with standardized 1.0 M HCl solution (Fisher) against \nphenolphthalein. Due to the very weakly acidic properties of hydrogen peroxide \n(pKa=11.75 [35]), the volume of the acid used to neutralize the NaOH sample \ncorresponded to the sum of the sodium hydroxide present in the sample and the \nNaOH produced as a result of hydroperoxide anion (HO2-) protonation. Since the \nlatter quantity was also equal to the amount of NaOH that would form as a \nresult of HO2- decomposition, the current efficiencies quoted in the report are \nnot corrected for peroxide.\n4.2.4. Standard startup, shutdown, current ramping and cell protecting \nprocedures\n4.2.4.1. Startup procedure and current ramping procedure\nBefore installing the cell in the test station, the brine recirculation \ntank (Fig. 5) and the recirculation pump were flushed with DI water to remove \nany chlorine, hypochlorite and chlorate left in the anolyte feed system from \nthe previous experiment. After the system was flushed, the recirculation tank \nwas filled with a freshly prepared 200 g/dm3 brine. The cell was placed in the \ntest station, the cartridge heaters and thermocouples were installed and the \nfeed/exhaust lines were connected to the cell. Water and nitrogen were then fed \nto the cathode compartment and the fresh brine recirculated through the anode \ncompartment of the cell. The cell and humidifier heaters were turned on. The \ncell temperature was increased in 10\u00baC increments. When the temperature of \nthe cell reached 80\u00baC, the power to the solenoid valves was manually \nturned on, which caused oxygen to replace the nitrogen in the feed line. After \nthat, a small protective current on the order of 1-2 A was immediately applied. \nThe Labview\u00ae software was started and the current density was increased at \nthe rate of 0.4 A cm-2 h-1 until it reached the desired value, most typically \n0.2 A/cm2 (10 A for the standard 50 cm2 cell). While the cell current was being \nincreased, the oxygen flow was adjusted to the desired level, the brine make-up \npump started and the brine flow roughly adjusted to the level required by the \ntarget current density. The cathode compartment was pressurized either during \nthe ramping or afterwards. The cathode pressurization was done in small \nincrements by manually adjusting the pressure of nitrogen feeding the \nbackpressure regulator. When the pressurization was complete the flow of water \nto the humidifier was adjusted to the desired level. The adjustment of the \nwater flow could not be done before, as the gas pressure influenced the output \nfrom the humidifier pump (Fig. 5). By the time the above operations were \ncompleted, the cell temperature was already 90\u00baC. The brine concentration \nin the recirculation tank was then adjusted to the desired level. This was done \nby frequently measuring the brine concentration in the recirculation tank and \nadjusting the brine make-up pump speed accordingly, until the brine \nconcentration stabilized at the desired level.\nRamping the current to a higher value was done in a similar way. As the \ncathode compartment was already pressurized, there was no need for readjusting \nthe water flow as long as the intended oxygen humidification level remained \nunchanged. The startup procedure for the cells equipped with MEAs was preceded \nby soaking the MEA in dilute NaOH (pH=12) solution (see section 4.2.1).\n4.2.4.2. Shutdown procedure\nShutting down the experiment started with turning off the cell heaters, \nreducing brine supply to the recirculation tank and applying the protective \ncurrent of 1 \u2013 2 A. When the cell temperature reached around 30 - \n40\u00baC, the electrolysis was stopped, the oxygen and brine flows were \nstopped and the cell removed immediately from the station. Both the anode and \nthe cathode compartments were flushed with DI water and the cell was \nimmediately disassembled.\n4.2.4.3. Temporary shutdown of the cell\nIn some cases, it was desirable to discontinue the experiment for a period \nof time and then restart it after the break. In such cases, the electrolysis \nwas stopped, i.e., zero current was applied to the cell. Immediately after \nthat, the oxygen flow was stopped and replaced by nitrogen flow by manually \nturning off the power to the solenoid valves. The cathode humidification rate \nwas increased to wash out the remaining NaOH from the cathode compartment. The \nfresh brine supply to the recirculation tank was stopped. While the anolyte \nrecirculation pump was still recirculating, most of the brine was drained and \nreplaced with hot (~90\u00baC) DI water to maintain the cell temperature. This \noperation was repeated several times, until the stable open circuit voltage was \nmeasured. Then, the cell and humidifier heaters were turned off and the cell \nwas left to cool down. When the cell temperature equilibrated, the nitrogen and \nwater flows to the cathode compartment were stopped and the brine recirculation \npump was turned off. The brine feed and chlorine/brine exhaust lines were \ndisconnected from the cell and the anode compartment was completely filled with \nfresh DI water. The cathode compartment was depressurized and left filled with \nDI water and nitrogen.\n4.2.5. Instrumentation\nConstant current electrolysis was performed using a Lambda model LYS-K-5-0V \nor a PowerOne model SPM3A2K DC power supply coupled to a Hewlett Packard 6060B \nelectronic load-box. The load-box was also coupled to a high frequency \nresistance measurement system that was comprised of a Voltech model TF200 \nfrequency response analyzer and two Stanford Research Systems model SR560 \nlow-noise preamplifiers for current and voltage signals. The system was \ncontrolled by Labview\u00ae software (National Instruments) installed on a \nMacIntosh computer. A cell voltage measurement was performed every six minutes \nand was immediately followed by a resistance measurement. In the latter case, a \nhigh frequency (2 kHz) ac signal of small amplitude (30 mV) modulated the \nvoltage of the load-box and consequently the cell voltage and the current. The \nratio of the ac components of the cell voltage and the current was assumed to \nbe equal to the ion-exchange membrane resistance, hereafter called high \nfrequency resistance (HFR). The error associated with this approximation was \nrather small, as the observed phase shift was typically in the range of 15-17o.\n\nThe system was also equipped with a Hewlett Packard model 3488A \nswitch/control unit, a model 3421A data acquisition/control unit, as well as an \nIOTech model 488/4 serial bus converter. These were responsible for switching \nbetween the different modes of measurement, data acquisition from the two test \nstations, and data transfer to the computer.\n4.3. Results\n4.3.1. Cathode Modifications Aimed at Improving Caustic Current \nEfficiency\nStandard hydrogen-evolving membrane cells are fed with 30% NaOH and \ngenerate 32% NaOH. This concentration range offers the best overall performance \nof the cell. However, one of the essential requirements of achieving the \nhighest cell performance is the high rate of internal mixing in the cathode \ncompartment, since non-uniform sodium hydroxide concentration may lead to \nperformance deterioration. The hydrogen-evolving cathode consumes water and \nhence the sodium hydroxide concentration in its vicinity becomes higher than \nthat in the bulk of NaOH. A similar boundary layer is also formed at the \nmembrane surface, where the NaOH concentration is largely determined by the \namount of water transported through the membrane. If the cathode and the \nmembrane are very close to each other, both boundary layers may merge, and the \ncathode reaction may cause a further loss of water in the immediate vicinity of \nthe membrane. Such an effect may lead to an increased membrane resistance and \npossibly even to membrane damage due to ohmic overheating of the carboxylic \nlayer. Identical issues could also be expected for the oxygen-depolarized cells.\n\nOne may expect the cells employed in this study to be more susceptible to \nthe undesired effects of the boundary layers due to their zero-gap design. \nHowever, the real situation is more complex. Unlike in the standard \nhydrogen-evolving cells, where the proper water balance in the vicinity of the \nmembrane and the desired 32% concentration of the caustic product are \nmaintained by simple means, i.e., by feeding the cell with approximately 30% \nNaOH, the cathode compartment of the cells used in this study was fed \nexclusively with oxygen and water. Moreover, the transport of water, caustic \nand oxygen, both within the cathode and between the cathode and the membrane, \nis governed by variety of driving forces, including capillary phenomena, \npressure gradients, electric field gradients, etc. Consequently, predicting the \nactual NaOH concentration distribution may be more difficult.\nIn Figure 6, the cell voltages are plotted versus the current density for \nthree experiments, where the cells equipped with the standard ELAT\u00ae \nelectrodes (Fig. 3) were run at three different levels of oxygen \nhumidification. The plots obtained for the dry oxygen and for the 0.5 cm3/min \nhumidification exhibit some degree of non-linearity, which is frequently \nregarded as a sign of non-optimized membrane performance. The plot obtained for \nthe saturated water vapor covers only a limited range of current densities and \nno conclusion regarding its linearity can be made. Since other factors, e.g., \nchanges in transport of the reagents, may have also contributed to the observed \nphenomena, the effects of oxygen humidification were examined in more detail.\n \nFigure 6. Cell voltages measured at low oxygen humidification \nlevels. Red symbols \u2013 no humidification. Black symbols \u2013 oxygen with \nsaturated water vapor. Four \u2013 serpentine channel graphite cathode \nflow-field/current collector. Membrane 1. \nSince the voltage vs. current density plot for the cell humidified with 0.5 \ncm3 of water per minute is convex, and the plot obtained for the dry oxygen is \nconcave, we believe that different factors contributed to the non-linearity of \nthe plots. For obvious reasons, the curvature of the plot obtained for the \nnon-humidified cell (Fig. 6) is more likely to have originated from the \ninteraction of the cathode and the membrane boundary layers, which resulted in \ntoo high catholyte concentration in the immediate vicinity of the membrane. \nConsequently, the water balance in the non-humidified cell was further \nexplored. Figure 7 shows the concentration of the product NaOH, the molar ratio \nof water to sodium transported through the membrane, and the hypothetical NaOH \nconcentration at the membrane surface, which would be observed if the cathode \nreaction did not consume water from the immediate vicinity of the membrane. \nBoth, the hypothetical NaOH concentration and the water to sodium molar ratio \nwere calculated from the product concentration by correcting it for the amount \nof water, which was consumed by the ORR. \nFigure 7. \nConcentrations of NaOH generated with and without oxygen humidification and the \nnumber of water molecules transferred through the membrane as a result of the \nelectroosmotic drag. Four \u2013 serpentine channel graphite cathode \nflow-field/current collector. Membrane 1. a \u2013 final product concentration. \nb \u2013 hypothetical NaOH concentration at the membrane surface (see text).\n \nFor comparison, concentration of the caustic product obtained from the \nelectrolysis using the water vapor saturated oxygen and the calculated \nconcentration of the NaOH product, which would be generated if the HER rather \nthan ORR was the cathode reaction in the non-humidified cell, are also shown in \nFig. 7.\nWhen there is no external humidification, the only water available in the \ncathode compartment is that transported from the anode compartment through the \nmembrane. This water is used inside the catalyst layer by the ORR, which \nconcentrated the NaOH solution above the level resulting from the relative \nquantities of sodium and water transported through the membrane (Fig. 7). Since \nthere is no source of water on the main escape route of caustic from the \nelectrode through the gas diffusion layer towards the flow-field, we believe \nthat the concentration of NaOH inside the electrode and in the thin boundary \nlayer between the electrode and the membrane monotonically decreases from its \nhighest value inside the electrode, which is equal to the final product \nconcentration, to some value at the membrane surface, whose the lower limit is \ndetermined by the membrane transport properties (red curve marked with \n\u201cb\u201d in Fig. 7).\nIn accordance with the above analysis, the NaOH concentration next to the \nmembrane, when no external humidification was applied, should lie between the \ntwo approximately parallel red lines in Fig. 7, which represent the final NaOH \nconcentration and the hypothetical one, calculated as if the ORR consumed no \nwater. The exact values of this concentration are unknown, but it seems that \nperformance problems can be expected at low current densities (= 0.4 A/cm2), \nwhere the NaOH concentration in the membrane vicinity can reach the maximum \nvalue of 38 - 40 %. Consequently, the concave shape of the voltage vs. current \ndensity plot for the non-humidified cell in Fig. 6 results from the excessively \nhigh cell voltages at the low current densities rather than at high current \ndensities (= 0.8 A/cm2), where the NaOH concentrations next to the membrane are \nlower due to increased water transport through the membrane (Fig. 7).\nFigure 8 shows the high frequency resistance measured for the three levels \nof oxygen humidification. As clearly seen in Fig. 8, the high frequency \nresistance in the non-humidified cell (red curve in Fig. 8) at low current \ndensities (= 0.4 A/cm2) is very high, which supports the hypothesis that the \nconcave shape of the voltage versus current density plot for this cell (Fig. 6) \nreflects too high cell voltages originating from the boundary layer effects. On \nthe other hand, the convex shape of the respective plot for the cell humidified \nwith 0.5 cm3/min of liquid water pumped into the cell, most likely reflects \npartial flooding of the cathode with caustic solution at high current densities \n(= 0.8 A/cm2). A similar effect occurs to a lesser extent in the cell utilizing \ndry oxygen, because the volume of the NaOH solution generated under such \nconditions is smaller.\nFigure 8 shows the high frequency resistance measured for the three levels \nof oxygen humidification. As clearly seen in Fig. 8, the high frequency \nresistance in the non-humidified cell (red curve in Fig. 8) at low current \ndensities (= 0.4 A/cm2) is very high, which supports the hypothesis that the \nconcave shape of the voltage versus current density plot for this cell (Fig. 6) \nreflects too high cell voltages originating from the boundary layer effects.

A similar effect occurs to a lesser extent in the cell utilizing \ndry oxygen, because the volume of the NaOH solution generated under such \nconditions is smaller.\nThe apparent lack of performance issues at high current densities in the \ncell fed with dry oxygen suggests that the harmful effect of the increased \nwater consumption by the ORR is more than compensated by the enhanced water \ntransport through the membrane. \nFigure 8.

Green line \n\u2013 humidification 0.5 cm3/min. Four - serpentine channel graphite cathode \nflow-field/current collector. Membrane 1. Pt catalyst loading: 5.0 mg/cm2 - red \nline; 0.5 mg/cm2 \u2013 green and black line. \nThis is one of the attractive features of the technology utilizing \noxygen-depolarized cathodes, as compared to the conventional membrane \ntechnology. While the hydrogen evolution reaction (eq.1) in the standard \nmembrane cell consumes one mole of water to produce one mole of NaOH, the \noxygen reduction consumes two times less water (eq.2) and thus it is less \nlikely to lead to significant dehydration of the boundary layer (see the lines \nmarked with \u201ca\u201d in Fig. 7).\nIt has to be noted that the HFR measured at 1.0 A/cm2 is virtually \nidentical for the cells fed with dry oxygen and humidified with 0.5 cm3/min of \nliquid water. Such a result suggests that the cathode/membrane boundary \nconditions must be very similar in both cases and the NaOH concentration in the \nsolution between the membrane and the electrode is identical in both cells. \nOther important conclusions based on the plots in Fig. 8 are: (i) even the very \nlow oxygen humidification, corresponding to the saturated vapor, significantly \nlowers the high frequency resistance and thus NaOH concentration in the \nmembrane/electrode boundary layer at low and intermediate current densities (= \n0.6 A/cm2), (ii) at 0.6 A/cm2, the saturated water vapor lowers the high \nfrequency resistance as effectively as 0.5 cm3 of water per minute directly \npumped into the cathode compartment.\nIn similarity to the high frequency resistance, the caustic current \nefficiency was found to be rather sensitive to the oxygen humidification. \nHowever, there was no straightforward correlation between the current \nefficiency and the level of humidification. The highest current efficiencies \nwere observed for the cell fed with water vapor saturated oxygen, the lowest \ncurrent efficiencies were observed for the cell humidified with 0.5 cm3/min of \nliquid water, whereas intermediate values were obtained for the cell fed with \ndry oxygen. Moreover, the level of humidification had a profound effect on the \ndependence of the CCE on current density. This is demonstrated in Fig. 9, where \nthe CCE is plotted versus the current density for the three levels of \nhumidification.\nIn order to explain the differences in the plots shown in Fig. 9, one has \nto consider a variety of factors that influence caustic current efficiency. \nSince there are no cathode side reactions which could lower the efficiency of \nNaOH generation, the only reason for lower than 100% current efficiency is the \ncrossover of NaOH. This process can occur either by diffusion of the \nnon-dissociated NaOH or by migration of hydroxyl anions through the membrane to \nthe anode compartment. If there were no changes in membrane permeability \nassociated with the changes in current density, both processes would exhibit a \nrelatively simple dependence on the experimental conditions. The rate of \ndiffusion would be independent of current density and proportional to the NaOH \nconcentration at the membrane surface. The rate of migration of the hydroxyl \nions would increase with the increase in NaOH concentration and with the \nincrease in current density. \nFigure 9.

Green line \n\u2013 humidification 0.5 cm3/min. Four - serpentine channel graphite cathode \nflow-field/current collector. Membrane 1. Pt catalyst loading: 5.0 mg/cm2 - red \nline; 0.5 mg/cm2 \u2013 green and black line. \nHowever, the changes in current density produce changes in the physical \nproperties of the membrane, which affect the membrane permeability and \ntransport properties. Higher current densities promote more significant \nmembrane swelling and increase its water content. As a result, the membrane \nbecomes more \u201copen\u201d and the transport of water through the membrane \nbecomes easier, as already demonstrated by the plot of the water to sodium \nratio in Fig. 7. The more open structure also promotes transport of any other \nmolecule or ion, including the undesired NaOH crossover. The membrane \npermeability is further increased by humidification, which lowers the NaOH \nconcentration in the membrane vicinity. On the other hand, the lower NaOH \nconcentration results in a lower driving force for NaOH transport through the \nmembrane to the anode compartment. As a consequence, the CCE is a complex \nfunction of all the individual factors mentioned above. In accordance with this \nstatement, we did not find any simple relationship between the CCE and any \nsingle parameter such as the HFR, current density (Fig. 9), or NaOH \nconcentration.\nThe differences between the plots in Fig. 9 can be qualitatively explained \nas follows. In the cell where the dry oxygen was used, the NaOH concentration \nin the membrane vicinity at all current densities is the highest possible. The \nincrease in current density significantly decreases the HFR (Fig. 8) and \nenhances permeability of the membrane (Fig. 7). Even though the concentration \ndependent driving force for the NaOH and OH- transport through the membrane \ndecreases with the decrease in current density (Fig. 7), the increasingly open \nstructure of the membrane and the increasing electric field in the membrane \nresult in lowering of the CCE.\nWhen the oxygen is saturated with water vapor, the concentration of the \nproduct NaOH is significantly lower than in the absence of humidification (Fig. \n7). While the actual NaOH concentrations at the membrane surface are not known, \nthey must be lower than in the cell without humidification (cf. also Fig. 8), \nwhich results in the lower driving force for the crossover. At the same time, \nthe NaOH concentrations are not sufficiently low to cause significant changes \nin the membrane water content. The current efficiencies are higher than for the \nnon-humidified cell.\nThe lowest current efficiencies were observed for the cell humidified with \nthe 0.5 cm3/min of liquid water. In this case, the most important factor \ndetermining the CCE is the concentration of NaOH and its influence on the \nmembrane permeability. Unlike in the two previous cases, the concentration of \nthe NaOH product increases with the increase in current density (Fig. 10) due \nto the relatively large volume of water introduced to the cell, which is \ncomparable with the volume of NaOH solution generated without humidification.\n \nFigure 10. Caustic current efficiency at different oxygen \nhumidification levels plotted versus concentration of the product NaOH. Red \nlines \u2013 no humidification. Black line \u2013 oxygen with saturated water \nvapor. Green line \u2013 humidification 0.5 cm3/min. Four - serpentine channel \ngraphite cathode flow-field/current collector. Membrane 1. Pt catalyst loading: \n5.0 mg/cm2 - red line; 0.5 mg/cm2 \u2013 green and black line. The arrows \nindicate current density increase. \nAs a consequence, the NaOH solutions generated at lower current densities \nare markedly diluted, which leads to the unusually significant membrane \nswelling (see also the HFR, Fig. 8) and the very enhanced NaOH crossover. The \ncurrent efficiency is low and increases with the current density.In accordance \nwith the above logic, the current efficiency for all levels of humidification \nseem to converge at high current densities, where the membrane is significantly \nswelled and the volume of water introduced to the cathode compartment is \nrelatively small compared to the volume of caustic generated.\nIn previous work, we departed slightly from the zero-gap concept by \nintroducing for the first time a hydrophilic spacer between the electrode and \nthe membrane. The spacer was found helpful in maintaining stable caustic \ncurrent efficiency at a level of a little below 90% at 1.0 A/cm2, reducing \nperoxide generation and lowering the cell voltage. As we suspected that the \nspacer could promote formation of the stagnant layer of concentrated caustic \nbetween the electrode and the membrane, we created a small opening in the upper \npart of the electrode and directed water from the humidifier to this opening to \ndilute and help remove the caustic from the spacer. After having realized that \nthe boundary layer effects in our zero-gap cells may actually be weaker than \ninitially suspected, we decided to modify the cell design and abandon the idea \nof direct humidification of the spacer. The modified cell allowed for no direct \nspacer humidification and resulted in a significant improvement of the caustic \ncurrent efficiency at current densities not exceeding 0.6 A/cm2 (Fig.11).\n Figure 11.

Panex\u00ae 30 carbon cloth spacer \nbetween the oxygen cathode and the membrane. \nNo clear effect of this modification on the current efficiency at high \ncurrent densities (0.8-1.0 A/cm2) could be detected. However, the modification \nresulted in a small decrease in the cell voltage (Fig.12). \n\nFigure 12. Effect of direct humidification of the hydrophilic spacer on the \ncell voltage. Platinum catalyst loading 0.5 mg/cm2. Humidification 0.5 cm3/min. \nMembrane 1. Panex\u00ae 30 carbon cloth spacer between the oxygen cathode and \nthe membrane. \nIt was previously noted by us that uncontrolled discontinuation of the \nelectrolysis resulting from a power outage or brownout frequently led to a \ndecrease in the caustic current efficiency after the experiment was restarted. \nThe most frequent scenario involved relatively short period of time, when no \nequipment was working, but the cathode compartment was flushed with oxygen or \nnitrogen, depending on whether the system was already equipped with the \nsolenoid valves and the relay, which prevented the valves from reenergizing \nonce the power was back (see part 4.2.2. and Fig. 5). This period of time was \nfollowed by a typically much longer period of time after the power was \nrestored, when all the electrical equipment was working with exception of the \nLabview\u00ae computer software. \nFigure 13. Effect of an \nuncontrolled interruption of the electrolysis on caustic current efficiency in \nthe cell equipped with the integrated graphite cathode flow-field/current \ncollector. The cell heated and flushed with oxygen during the interruption. \nMembrane 1. \nUnder such conditions (see conditions 1 and 2, Table 2), the cell was \nheated, the anode compartment was flushed with the brine from the anolyte \nrecirculation tank (see Fig. 5) and the cathode compartment was flushed with \nwater and nitrogen or, in many earlier experiments, with oxygen. The cell \nremained at its respective open circuit voltage, which was determined by the \nredox properties of the chemical species present in both the anode and the \ncathode compartment. After a sufficiently long time, the brine make-up pump \neventually replaced the brine in the recirculation tank with the fresh brine, \nwhich did not contain oxidizers, e.g., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, hypochlorous \nacid and sodium chlorate, but it was significantly more concentrated (310 \ng/dm3). Also, a significant portion of the concentrated NaOH was washed out \nfrom the cathode compartment by the humidification water. Since the cathode \nhardware corrosion and the associated catalyst and membrane poisoning often \naccompanied this phenomenon, no unambiguous conclusion could be made as to the \norigin of the phenomenon and the ways of preventing or minimizing the decline \nin current efficiency. In one experiment, which was not influenced by the \ncathode hardware corrosion thanks to the use of the corrosion resistant \ngraphite hardware, the current efficiency dropped from around 90% to around 86% \nas a result of an uncontrolled interruption of the electrolysis (Fig. 13). \nAfter approximately 20 hours, when the cell remained under the open circuit \nconditions, the electrolysis was restarted and the current efficiency \nrelatively quickly returned to the level of approximately 90% (Fig. 13). \nReversible character of the performance decline following an interruption of \nthe electrolysis was also observed when the cell was equipped with the MEA-type \ncathode.\nThe undesired effects of power outages on caustic current efficiency seemed \nstronger and longer lasting in the cells equipped with the cathode spacers \n(Fig. 14), but one has to note the different conditions and history of the \nuncontrolled shutdowns as well as the different membranes used in the \nexperiments shown in Figs. 13 and 14.\nWhile there was no cathode hardware (flow-field and current collector) \ncorrosion in the experiments shown in Figs. 13 and 14, the conditions in the \ncathode compartment during the break in electrolysis were rather corrosive due \nto the presence of oxygen (Fig. 13) and/or the other oxidizers, e.g., chlorates \n(Figs. 13 and 14), which diffused from the anode compartment through the \nmembrane under the open circuit conditions. These oxidizers may have \ncontributed to corrosion of the electrode and the membrane, catalyst loss and \nchanges in electrode hydrophobicity, which may have influenced to some extent \nthe current efficiency. Indeed, after the unexpected shutdown of the \nelectrolysis, shown in Fig. 13, the cell started generating significant \nquantities of peroxide, which must have resulted from at least partial loss of \nthe platinum catalyst. \nFigure 14. Effect of an uncontrolled \ninterruption of the electrolysis on caustic current efficiency in the cell \nequipped with the silver-plated nickel flow-field and Panex\u00ae 30 hydrophilic \nspacer. No spacer humidification. The cell heated and flushed with nitrogen \nduring the interruption. Membrane 4. \nSubsequent experiments demonstrated that the current efficiency also \ndecreased when no oxidizers were present in the cathode compartment under the \nopen circuit conditions (Fig. 15). Consequently, the decrease in current \nefficiency could only be associated with the presence of highly concentrated \nbrine on the anode side of the membrane and caustic solution or water on the \ncathode side of the membrane. \nFigure 15. Effect of a \ncontrolled interruption of the electrolysis on caustic current efficiency in a \ncell equipped with the silver-plated nickel flow-field and Panex\u00ae 30 \nhydrophilic spacer. No spacer humidification. The anode compartment flushed \nwith deionized water and then with the fresh, concentrated brine. The \nconcentrated brine recirculated through the anode compartment. The cell heated \nduring the interruption. The cathode compartment flushed with nitrogen and DI \nwater. Membrane 4. \nOur first hypothesis was that the combination of water on the cathode side \nand concentrated brine on the anode side was more likely to cause problems than \nthe combination of caustic solution and brine. The reasoning was based on the \nsignificant differences in the ionic strength in the first case, which could \nlead to an undesired strain in the membrane and potentially even cause damage \nto the membrane structure. While the hydrophilic spacer in the experiments \nshown in Figs. 14 and 15 was not humidified, we suspected that the \nhumidification water, which was introduced into the cathode chamber, could have \neventually washed out the caustic present in the spacer by entering the spacer \nfrom the bottom of the cathode compartment, where the water transitionally \naccumulated before the backpressure regulator (Fig. 5) allowed it to drain.\n Figure 16. Effect of a controlled interruption of the electrolysis \non caustic current efficiency in a cell equipped with the silver-plated nickel \nflow-field and Panex\u00ae 30 hydrophilic spacer. No spacer humidification. The \nanode compartment flushed with deionized water and then with the fresh, \nconcentrated brine. The concentrated brine recirculated through the anode \ncompartment. The cell heated during the interruption. The cathode compartment \nflushed with nitrogen and DI water. Membrane 1. \nIn order to prove this hypothesis, another cell design was implemented. In \nthe modified cell, both the electrode and the spacer had smaller height than in \nthe standard cell. They were placed in the upper part of the cathode \ncompartment so that an empty space was created on the bottom of the cathode \ncompartment, where water could accumulate. The bottom part of the membrane, \nwhich would be excluded from the current flow, was covered with a strip of a \nthick Teflon foil to minimize the unwanted crossover of NaCl from the anode \ncompartment. The electrolysis was interrupted after more than 140 hours (more \nthan 40 hours at 1.0 A/cm2), the solution in the anode compartment was replaced \nwith the fresh brine and the cathode compartment was flushed with nitrogen and \ndeionized water. After approximately 80 hours, the electrolysis was restarted \nand the current density ramped to 1.0 A/cm2. The current efficiency measured a \nshort time after the restart was very low (~83%). The electrolysis was soon \ninterrupted for more than an hour by the Labview software as a result of the \noxygen shortage. Due to its short duration, the last interruption of the \nelectrolysis is believed to have only a minor, if any, effect on the subsequent \ncell performance. The results of this test are shown in Fig. 16. As seen in \nFig. 16, the controlled interruption of electrolysis had a profound effect on \nthe current efficiency. The caustic current efficiency at 1.0 A/cm2 dropped \nfrom around 91% before the interruption to approximately 83% following the \nbreak in the electrolysis. During the next ~100 hours after the break, the \ncurrent efficiency started increasing to eventually reach the level of around \n85%. However, it started decreasing slightly during the subsequent 100 hours. \nThe result of the above test is inconclusive. While any improvement in the \nmembrane performance resulting from the cell modification would indicate that \nthe significant difference in ionic strength on both sides of the membrane was \nresponsible for the performance deterioration, the lack of improvement may \nresult from variety of factors, also including inadequate masking of the part \nof the membrane which was excluded from the current flow. Consequently, the \nirreversible character of the performance deterioration in Fig. 16 does not \nimply irreversible damage to the membrane.\nThe origin of the performance losses caused by interruptions of the \nelectrolysis is unclear. It is obvious that the prolonged presence of \nconcentrated brine on the anode side and concentrated caustic or water on the \ncathode side contributes to the problem. While the reversible character of the \ncurrent efficiency changes in the cells equipped with no spacer (see above) may \nsuggest that the presence of concentrated caustic in the spacer is the major \nfactor leading to performance losses following an interruption of the \nelectrolysis, it has to be noted that the results presented in Fig. 13 may be \ninfluenced by other phenomena. In fact, the uncontrolled interruption of the \nelectrolysis in this case resulted in a very significant increase in the \nperoxide generation rate, which corresponded to around 36% of the current being \nused for peroxide generation after approximately 350 hours of electrolysis \n(Fig. 13). Such a high peroxide generation rate led to a significant lowering \nof the NaOH concentration and thus possibly to a decrease of the NaOH \ncrossover, which may have masked the current efficiency decrease resulting from \nthe deterioration of the membrane performance.\nThe problem of caustic current efficiency decline following an interruption \nof the electrolysis requires additional studies.\n4.3.2. Membrane Testing\nThe caustic current efficiency (CCE) and the ohmic drop in the cell are key \ncharacteristics determining performance of the membrane and its suitability for \nthe chlor-alkali electrolysis. A perfect chlor-alkali membrane would have \nvirtually no electrical resistance and guarantee almost 100% current \nefficiency. Unfortunately, the intrinsic membrane properties, which are \nresponsible for its conductivity and selectivity, affect these parameters in a \nsimilar way, i.e., low membrane resistance is typically associated with low \nselectivity (current efficiency) and vice versa. However, thanks to the complex \nnature of the transport phenomena in the membrane, the relationship between \nboth parameters is not straightforward and two different membranes can have \nidentical conductivity and different selectivity under identical operating \nconditions. The chlor-alkali membranes which are currently in use are comprised \nof two layers of polymers that contain different acidic groups. The carboxylic \nlayer on the cathode side of the membrane is more selective and less conductive \nthan the sulfonic layer on the anode side. Properties of both ionomers and \nthickness of the layers determine the overall membrane performance. They are \noptimized to guarantee the highest possible current efficiency (current \nindustrial standard for the membrane cell is ~96% at 0.4 A/cm2) and the lowest \npossible ohmic drop. Five different membranes were selected for testing. \nMembranes 1 through 4 were specialized chlor-alkali membranes. Two of them, \nmembrane 3 and 4 had the gas release coating on the cathode side removed. The \nfifth membrane, BPSH-30, was homemade. It was originally designed for the \ndirect methanol fuel cells to reduce methanol crossover. Its relatively low \npermeability was believed to promise high caustic current efficiencies.\nUnfortunately, this material failed before starting the electrolysis, \nduring the cell warm-up phase. Multiple micro cracks formed in the membrane, \nwhich eventually resulted in a brine leak from the anode to the cathode \ncompartment. The remaining materials were tested under the standard conditions \nin the cells equipped with the commercial double-sided ELAT\u00ae electrodes \ncontaining 0.5 mg/cm2 Pt (see section 4.2.1.) and the hydrophilic spacer (Fig. \n2). The spacer was not humidified (see section 4.3.1.). The standard anode \nstructure was used in all the experiments.\nThe tests were run at five consecutive current densities: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, \n0.8 A/cm2, and 1.0 A/cm2 for approximately 24 hours at each current density \nbelow 1.0 A/cm2 and for at least 24 hours or more at 1.0 A/cm2. The current \nefficiencies were determined in the middle of each 24-hour period of time and \nthe cell voltages were averaged over each 24-hour period.\nLinear regression of the cell voltage versus the current density is \ncommonly used to describe the membrane performance in a standard \nhydrogen-evolving cell. The slope of the voltage versus current density plot, \nor k-factor, is the membrane contribution. The intercept is the electrolyzer \ncontribution. The lower the k-factor, the less resistive the membrane is. Table \n1 shows the linear regression results of the data plotted in Fig. 17 together \nwith the available literature data obtained from the tests using standard \nhydrogen-evolving cells.\n \nFigure 17. Measured cell voltages for different bi-layer \nmembranes: membrane 1 \u2013 full triangles, membrane 2 \u2013 open squares, \nmembrane 3 \u2013 full squares, membrane 4 \u2013 full circles. \nInspection of the data in Table 1 reveals significantly lower values of the \nk-factor in our cells as compared to the standard hydrogen-evolving cells. The \norigin of this difference is quite understandable. The markedly higher \nk-factors for the hydrogen-evolving cells reflect non-negligible contributions \nto the cell voltages from the resistance of the liquid NaOH and NaCl \nelectrolytes in these cells. As such contribution was almost nonexistent in our \nzero-gap cells, one can estimate the electrolyte contribution to the measured \nk-factors for the standard membrane cells to be on the order of 33% and 31% for \nmembrane 3 and membrane 4, respectively. The lower voltages of our cells that \nresult from the different cathode reaction and their zero-gap design translate \ninto significant energy savings. These savings are approximately 38% at 0.31 \nA/cm2. \nTable 1. Linear regression results for the plots shown \nin Fig. 17. \nAnother important factor that determines the membrane performance is the \ncaustic current efficiency. Figure 18 shows the measured caustic current \nefficiency plotted versus the current density. Two different membrane responses \nto the changes in current density can be observed. Membrane 4 and 3, both \nspecifically designed for operations at higher than standard current densities, \nexhibit a gradual decline in the current efficiency with the increase in \ncurrent density from 0.2 to 1.0 A/cm2. For the remaining two membranes, \nmembrane 1 and 2, the current efficiency decreases with current density up to \n0.8 A/cm2 and then increases at 1.0 A/cm2. The origin of the current efficiency \nminimum is not clear. However, it seems possible that it is related to the \nmembrane response to changes in the anode boundary layer that result from the \ncurrent density changes. As shown in section 4.3.5., a monotonic relationship \nbetween the current efficiency and the current density was observed for \nmembrane 1, when one of the anode modifications was introduced. \nFigure 18. Current efficiency for different bi-layer membranes: \nmembrane 1 \u2013 full triangles, membrane 2 \u2013 open squares, membrane 3 \n\u2013 full squares, membrane 4 \u2013 full circles. \nNo clear correlation was found between the measured cell voltages and the \ncaustic current efficiency, although higher cell voltages (high membrane \nresistances) were frequently associated with higher current efficiency and vice \nversa (Figs. 17 and 18). Membrane 4 provided the highest current efficiency in \nthe whole range of current densities from 0.2 to 1.0 A/cm2 (Fig.18).\nFrom an economic perspective, the most important parameter determining \nmembrane quality is energy consumption per unit weight of the product. The \nenergy consumption is proportional to the product of the cell voltage and the \ncurrent (or current density) and inversely proportional to the caustic current \nefficiency. Consequently, in order to compare the energy efficiency for the \nmembranes tested, it is convenient to introduce a new parameter: G = \nconst*Energy = Voltage(V)*Current Density(A/cm2)/CCE(%) \nFigure \n19. Energy efficiency (see text) of different bi-layer membranes at low current \ndensities: membrane 1 \u2013 dotted green line, membrane 2 \u2013 black line, \nmembrane 3 \u2013 red line, membrane 4 \u2013 dashed blue line. \nThe parameter G reflects exclusively the amount of energy required to \nperform the electrolysis, whereas the total energy consumed by the chlor-alkali \nindustry also includes the energy used to generate steam, which is used for \nconcentrating the caustic soda to the level of 50%. Since the NaOH \nconcentrations generated in the cells equipped with the different membranes \nunder identical conditions were very similar and the average use of steam \naccounts for only around 16% of the total energy consumption by the \nchlor-alkali industry, we believe that equation 5 can be used with confidence \nfor the analysis of the energy efficiency of cells equipped with the different \nmembranes. The parameter G is plotted versus current density in Figures 19 and \n20 for the lower (0.2 - 0.6 A/cm2) and higher (0.8 - 1.0 A/cm2) current density \nranges, respectively.\nAs seen in Fig. 19, membrane 1, membrane 3, and membrane 4 offer very \nsimilar energy efficiency for current densities up to 0.6 A/cm2, whereas the \nuse of membrane 2 is associated with significantly higher energy consumption.\n \nFigure 20. Energy efficiency (see text) of different bi-layer \nmembranes at high current densities: membrane 1 \u2013 dotted green line, \nmembrane 2 \u2013 black line, membrane 3 \u2013 red line, membrane 4 \u2013 \ndashed blue line. \nThe performance of membrane 2 is even worse at the higher current densities \n(Fig.20). The demanding conditions of electrolysis at high current densities \nreveal differences in the performance of the remaining membranes too. While \nmembranes 3 and 4 still offer the lowest energy consumption, the latter \nperforming slightly worse at 1.0 A/cm2, performance of membrane 1 is noticeably \npoorer.\n4.3.3. Cathodes Utilizing Unsupported Catalysts\nAs our earlier experiments indicated, carbon supported platinum catalysts \nhad two disadvantages. Unexpected power outages, especially when oxygen was \npresent in the cathode compartment, led to catalyst loss as a result of \noxidation of the carbon support. Also, carbon particles are believed to \ncontribute to the unwanted peroxide generation. Consequently, attempts were \nundertaken to develop electrodes which would utilize unsupported catalysts.\nIn accordance with our expectations, we found that the degree of \nutilization of an unsupported catalyst was generally lower than that of the \nsame catalyst in the carbon supported form with the same nominal loading. A \nrepresentative result is shown in Figure 21, where the voltages of the cells \nequipped with the cathodes containing supported and unsupported (HiSpec\u00ae \n1000) platinum catalysts are plotted versus the electrolysis time.\nIn general, both the measured and the iR-corrected voltages of the cell \nequipped with the unsupported catalyst MEA were higher than those determined \nfor the cell equipped with the standard ELAT. However, the differences between \nthe measured (uncorrected) voltages were generally larger due to the higher HFR \n(not shown in Fig. 21) of the membrane used in the cell equipped with the \nunsupported catalyst MEA (membrane 2) as compared to that used in the cell \nequipped with the standard ELAT (membrane 1). The differences between the \niR-corrected voltages (Fig. 21) reflect the differences in the activity and \nutilization of the catalyst in both cells. They are negligible at 0.2 A/cm2 and \nsmall at 0.4 A/cm2, but become significant at higher current densities, as \nreflected by the corrected voltages for the MEA cathode, higher from 100 mV to \n200 mV than those determined for the ELAT cathode (Fig. 21).\nThe lower degree of utilization of the unsupported catalyst results from \nthe smaller distances between catalyst particles and from possible particle \nagglomeration. As a result, a fraction of the catalyst surface area is \ncompletely inaccessible. Another fraction of the surface area, although in \nprinciple accessible, cannot be fully utilized since the closely neighboring \nparticles compete with each other as reduction centers, which results in \ninsufficient supply of the reactants to their surface. The effect is \nsignificant enough to overrule the favorable effect of the approximately two \ntimes higher specific surface area of the unsupported catalyst. \nFigure 21. Measured and iR-corrected voltages for the cells equipped \nwith the standard ELAT cathode and the hydrophilic spacer (black line) and the \nMEA-type cathode (red line). The catalyst content: ELAT \u2013 5.0 mg/cm2 \ncarbon (Vulcan XC72) supported Pt, MEA \u2013 5.0 mg/cm2 unsupported Pt (HiSpec \n1000). Membrane 1 (black line), membrane 2 (red line). \nThe catalytic activity/degree of utilization of the unsupported Pt catalyst \ndecreased during the first 80 \u2013 100 hours of the electrolysis, as \nmanifested by the increase in the measured and the corrected cell voltages \n(Figs. 21 and 22), before it became stable. Since during this period of time, \nthe standard experimental procedure of the stepwise ramping of the current was \nfollowed, it is unknown whether the current density, time or both were \nresponsible for the effect. However, the most profound changes seemed to occur \nat 0.6 A/cm2 and 0.8 A/cm2, whereas the voltages were rather stable at 0.2 A/cm2\n and 1.0 A/cm2. \nFigure 22. iR-corrected voltages for the \nMEA-type cathodes (red line) containing 5.0 mg/cm2 of different catalysts. \nMembrane 2. \nIn principle, the increase in the corrected cell voltage can result from a \ndecrease of accessible surface area of the catalyst or inhibition of the \nelectrode process due to catalyst poisoning. Since a similar voltage increase \nwas never observed in the case of carbon-supported platinum (Fig. 21), the \ndecrease of the accessible surface area of the catalyst seems to be a more \nlikely origin of the observed phenomenon. Two different phenomena may have \ncontributed to this decrease, namely: catalyst particle agglomeration and \ndisintegration of the catalyst layer. On the other hand, partial delamination \nof the membrane and the catalyst layer could not be responsible for the \nobserved voltage increase, because such a phenomenon would be accompanied by an \nincrease in the HFR, whereas no such increase was observed (Fig. 23). \nFigure 23. High frequency resistance of the MEA containing 5.0 mg/cm2 \nPt (HiSpec 1000). Membrane 2. \nOne has to note that no similar phenomenon was observed in the case of \nruthenium-containing catalysts. As shown below, these catalysts undergo \ncorrosion under the experimental conditions due to the surface oxidation of \nruthenium, which eventually leads to formation of soluble ruthenates. \nDissolution of the outermost catalyst layer exposes underlying layers and most \nlikely also prevents particle agglomeration. As a consequence, no change in the \nnet accessible surface area may be observed. We believe that catalyst corrosion \nmust be accompanied by some disintegration of the catalyst layer. Since this \nphenomenon does not seem to induce an increase in the ohmic drop corrected \nvoltages for the ruthenium-based catalysts (Fig. 22), disintegration of the \ncatalyst layer containing pure Pt catalyst does not seem to be a very likely \ncause of the increase in the cell voltage. Consequently, particle agglomeration \nis the most likely cause of the performance losses of the MEA containing pure \nPt catalyst.\nIn the case of platinum-ruthenium catalyst, the dissolution of ruthenium \nmay result in formation of smaller, platinum enriched particles, which can \nstill retain the activity of the original particles. Such an explanation of the \nlack of effect of the ruthenium dissolution on the activity of the \nplatinum-ruthenium catalyst remains in accordance with the higher catalytic \nactivity of platinum for the oxygen reduction.\nAs mentioned above, we found that ruthenium-based catalysts underwent \nsignificant corrosion during the electrolysis. The rate of dissolution of the \nmixed platinum-ruthenium catalyst was higher than that of pure ruthenium (Fig. \n24.a). This effect could be associated with the smaller particle size of the \nPt/Ru catalyst and thus the weaker bonding of Ru in the solid phase. While the \nconcentration of the corrosion product, ruthenate, in the NaOH solution, \nstrongly depended on the current density and thus the cell voltage (Fig. 24.b), \nthe dissolution rate of ruthenium from the catalyst was relatively weakly \ndependent on the cell voltage and consequently on the cathode overpotential. \nMoreover, the dissolution rate did not decrease monotonically with the increase \nof cell voltage as would be expected, if the catalysts were undergoing a simple \nelectrochemical oxidation. This indicates the complex character of the \ndissolution process and possible participation of chemical reactions that may \nbe the rate determining steps of the overall reaction. The chemical steps most \nlikely involve ruthenium oxides. \nFigure 24.a. Dissolution \nrates of the ruthenium-containing catalysts plotted versus the cell voltage \ncorrected for the ohmic losses.\n Figure 24.b. UV-Vis spectra of the NaOH \nsolutions generated at different current densities. The current densities in \nA/cm2 are listed at each spectrum. \nThree different materials were tested as gas diffusion layers for the MEAs \nwith unsupported catalysts. Figure 25 shows the unacceptable performance of the \n60% teflonized Toray\u00ae paper used as the gas diffusion layer (GDL) together \nwith the MEA containing 5.0 mg/cm2 of the pure Ru catalyst. Transport of the \nreagents and products through the paper was severely hindered, which resulted \nin unacceptably high cell voltages and the hydrogen evolution even at the \nlowest current densities. As the hydrogen generation posed a serious safety \nhazard, the experiments with the Toray\u00ae paper were eventually abandoned. \nBoth the purity of sodium hydroxide generated and the appearance of the \ncatalyst layer after the experiment implied no catalyst corrosion during the \nexperiment. In fact, the lack of catalyst corrosion and the hydrogen evolution \nduring the electrolysis strongly indicated that the cathode reaction was \noccurring exclusively on the surface of the paper rather than in the catalyst \nlayer of the MEA.\nFigure 26 shows the measured (as well as corrected for the ohmic drop) \nvoltages for two cells equipped with the MEAs containing 5.0 mg/cm2 Pt (HiSpec\n\u00ae 1000) and two different, low temperature, gas diffusion layers, LT 1400-W \nELAT (single-sided) and LT 2500-W ELAT (double-sided). As seen in Fig. 26, the \ndouble-sided gas diffusion layer performed significantly better, as reflected \nby the significantly lower cell voltages (around 200 mV at 1.0 A/cm2). The \nhigher voltages observed for the single-sided gas diffusion layer are believed \nto result from its higher flooding susceptibility. \nFigure 25. \nComparison of 60% teflonized Toray\u00ae paper and LT 1400-W gas diffusion \nlayers in the cells equipped with the MEAs containing 5.0 mg/cm2 Ru catalyst.\n \nThe oscillations of the ohmic drop corrected voltages of the cell employing \nthe single-sided GDL (Fig. 26) can also be attributed to periodic changes in \nthe degree of flooding of the GDL.\nUnlike the standard ELATs with carbon supported platinum catalyst, the MEAs \nutilizing unsupported platinum were found to be resistant to corrosion during \nuncontrolled interruptions of electrolysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 27, after \nan 8 hour long interruption of the electrolysis, the cell equipped with the MEA \nwas operated for more than 200 hours without any performance loss. However, a \nseveral days long interruption of the electrolysis under conditions used \nroutinely to prevent catalyst loss from the electrodes utilizing carbon \nsupported platinum (see Table 2, condition 4), led to irreversible loss of \nperformance. \nFigure 26. Comparison of performance of \nsingle-sided and double-sided gas diffusion layers applied in the cells \nequipped with the MEAs containing 5.0 mg/cm2s Pt catalyst (HiSpec\u00ae 1000).\n \nWhen the electrolysis was restarted and the current density brought back to \n1.0 A/cm2, the measured voltages were unacceptably high and shortly thereafter \nthe cell had to be shut down. The post mortem examination of the MEA revealed \nsignificant delamination of the catalyst layer and the membrane. The increased \nand uneven swelling of the membrane and the Nafion binder is suspected to be a \nmajor factor responsible for the delamination. \nFigure 27. \nEffect of controlled and uncontrolled interruption of the electrolysis on \nperformance of the cell equipped with the MEA-type cathode. The arrows indicate \nvoltages measured at identical current densities before and after the \nelectrolysis interruption. Membrane 2. Platinum catalyst (HiSpec 1000) loading \n5.0 mg/cm2. \nCaustic current efficiency in the cells equipped with the MEA-type cathodes \nwas similar to that in the cells equipped with the hydrophilic spacer, which \nwas not humidified (Fig. 28). The largest difference between the current \nefficiencies (>2%) obtained for these two types of cells was observed at 0.2 \nA/cm2. The lower current efficiency in the cell equipped with the MEA may \noriginate from the potentially easier access of water to the membrane in this \ncase. \nFigure 28. Comparison of caustic current efficiency of \nthe cells equipped with MEA and with separate gas diffusion electrode. \nCatalyst: 5.0 mg/cm2 Pt. Membrane 2. MEA-type cathode \u2013 black symbols, \nseparate gas diffusion electrode \u2013 red symbols. Current efficiencies \n\u2013 closed symbols. Current densities \u2013 open symbols. \nThe water introduced to the cathode compartment of the cell equipped with \nthe separate gas diffusion electrode and the spacer has to be transported \nthrough the hydrophobic gas diffusion layer of the electrode, then through the \nless but still hydrophobic catalyst layer and finally through the relatively \nthick spacer filled with the NaOH solution, before it can reach the membrane. \nOn the other hand, in a cell equipped with the MEA, the only barrier in the way \nof water toward the membrane is the hydrophobic gas diffusion layer. Once the \nwater reaches the hydrophilic binder in the catalyst layer, it can \n\u201cfreely\u201d diffuse towards the membrane. The overall effect of easier \nwater transport in this case is small and limited to the lowest current \ndensity, because the main source of water in the catalyst layer is the water \nvapor rather than liquid water, which constitutes the largest fraction of water \nfrom the humidifier (see also section 4.3.1.). The results shown in Fig. 28 \ndemonstrate that deposition of the catalyst layer onto the membrane did not \naffect adversely the membrane permeability and selectivity at the higher \ncurrent densities.\n4.3.4. Corrosion of the Cathode Hardware\nIn order to minimize ohmic losses in the cell, cathode hardware parts, \ni.e., the flow-field and the current collector must be made of electrically \nconductive material. A limited number of conductive materials, predominantly \nnoble metals and their alloys, can withstand the strongly corrosive environment \nin the cathode compartment (highly concentrated caustic soda, high temperature, \noxygen, and sometimes peroxide). In addition, the electrical potential of the \nhardware parts during the electrolysis may adversely affect the corrosion \nresistance of these materials. For instance, a material, which is corrosion \nresistant at its open circuit potential due to the passivation of its surface \nby an oxide layer, may lose its passivity at the potential of electrolysis.\nSome of our experiments with the fuel cell type cathode hardware involved \nthe integrated cathode collector/flow-field made of graphite, which was both \ncorrosion resistant and inexpensive. Unfortunately, peroxide generation in the \ncells equipped with the graphite parts was unacceptably high (see part 4.3.6.). \nAnother drawback of the graphite hardware was its high porosity that led to \ncaustic leakage through the current collector plate when the cathode \ncompartment was pressurized. Moreover, even though the machining of the \nflow-field channels into the graphite current collector block was relatively \neasy thanks to the softness of this material, the cost of the machining was \nrelatively high. Because of the above shortcomings, an effort was undertaken to \nreplace the graphite hardware with the separate metal current collector and \neasily scalable, non-machined flow-field.\nRelatively inexpensive metals/alloys were selected as the construction \nmaterials for the cathode hardware parts. These were stainless steel (SS 316) \nand nickel. Both metals exhibit satisfactory corrosion resistance in alkaline \nmedia at their respective open circuit potentials. The parts were electroplated \nwith noble metals, including gold and silver. The cells were run under the \ntypical experimental conditions (see part 4.2.) for at least ten consecutive \ndays. Then, the electrolysis was discontinued using either the standard \nshutdown procedure (see section 4.2.4.2.) or the procedure corresponding to one \nof the possible equipment failure modes as specified in Table 2 below.\nWe found that the gold-plated nickel hardware was undergoing significant \ncorrosion both during the electrolysis and under the open circuit conditions \nand the extent of corrosion seemed independent of the gold coating thickness \nranging from 50 to 500 microinches. When the electrical circuit was open and \nall the conditions were identical with those used during the electrolysis, \ni.e., the cell was heated, the brine was recirculated and the cathode \ncompartment was flushed with oxygen and water (condition 1 in Table 2), the \nextent of corrosion under the open circuit conditions was larger than during \nthe electrolysis. However, corrosion also occurred under the open circuit \nconditions when the cell was not heated and the cathode compartment was flushed \nwith nitrogen and water. While no tests were run for the gold plated nickel \nhardware under the set of conditions denoted by number 4 in Table 2, where all \npotential oxidizers were removed from both the cathode and the anode \ncompartment, we believe that chloride oxidation products, e.g., hypochlorite \nand chlorate, which diffused from the anode compartment, were responsible for \nthe corrosion of the cathode hardware under the open circuit conditions, when \nthe cathode compartment was flushed with nitrogen and the brine was \nrecirculated (condition 5).\nCorrosion of the Au coated nickel hardware is believed to occur via the \nelectrochemical mechanism. Tiny pinholes in the Au coating allow for formation \nof electrochemical microcells, where the exposed nickel surface acts as the \nanode and the gold surface as the cathode. Oxygen and/or the chloride oxidation \nproducts are reduced on the gold surface and nickel is oxidized. \nTable 2. The experimental conditions applied in the cathode hardware \ncorrosion testing \nFigure 29 below shows the extent of corrosion of the Au coated nickel \ncurrent collectors resulting from an uncontrolled power outage (condition 3 in \nTable 2). Corrosion of the cathode hardware also occurred, when the cathode \ncompartment was flushed with nitrogen and deionized water and brine containing \nchloride oxidation products was recirculated through the anode compartment. \nThis result clearly demonstrates that the chloride oxidation products, e.g., \nhypochlorite, chlorate, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, etc., do participate in \ncorrosion of the cathode hardware during uncontrolled interruptions of \nelectrolysis. \nFigure 29. Corrosion of the gold plated nickel \ncathode current collectors resulting from a sixteen day power failure. Coating \nthickness: 1 \u00b5m (left) and 10 \u00b5m (right). \nThe gold-plated stainless steel (SS 316) hardware exhibited significantly \nbetter corrosion resistance than the nickel hardware, but corrosion still \noccurred both during electrolysis and under open circuit conditions. However, \ncorrosion during electrolysis was almost negligible.\nThe silver-plated nickel hardware exhibited excellent corrosion resistance \nboth during the electrolysis and under the open circuit conditions. No \ncorrosion of the hardware could be detected for any condition listed in Table \n2. While every experiment, where the gold plated cathode hardware was used, \nrequired a new flow-field and a new current collector, the silver-plated nickel \nparts could be reused several times, as there was no detectable signs of \ncorrosion. The silver-plated cathode hardware parts were typically replaced \nafter five to seven experimental runs, even though no corrosion was present. \nThe reason for replacing the parts was gradual accumulation on the cathode side \nof the flow-field, of the black material from the cathode. The accumulation of \nthis material resulted from repetitive and long lasting pressing of the \nflow-field against the cathode, which was necessary to create the good \nelectrical contact between them. Although no measurable effect of this deposit \non the cell performance was detected, occasional replacement of the cathode \nhardware was intended to avoid the potential effects of the deposit on the \noverall cell resistance.\nA minor disadvantage of the silver-plated nickel hardware was that the \nflow-field and the current collector became virtually inseparable after a \nsingle experimental run. The origin of the effect is unknown, but \nelectrochemically induced recrystallization of the silver coating seems most \nprobable. Another effect that may have led to strong bonding between the \nhardware parts may involve formation of the shared silver oxide film on the \nsurfaces of the current collector and the flow-field.\n4.3.5. Anode Modifications\nAs the cathode and the cathode hardware modifications did not produce the \ndesired increase in caustic current efficiency, different modifications of the \nanode were also tried. Several phenomena in the anode compartment may have a \nnegative effect on the caustic current efficiency and other performance \ncharacteristics of the chlor-alkali cell. Large quantities of chlorine \ngenerated by the anode in close proximity of the membrane may lead to the \nso-called membrane blinding effect. The blinding effect is caused by chlorine \nbubbles, which partially block the membrane. The parts of the membrane that are \ncovered with bubbles cannot participate in ion transport. As a result, the \nremaining parts may carry much higher current densities than those for which \nthe membrane was designed and optimized. Since current efficiency tends to \ndecrease with an increase in current density, the overall effect of gas \nblinding will be a decrease in the caustic current efficiency.\nCaustic current efficiency can also be affected by other phenomena \nassociated with the anode performance. As the chlorine evolution reaction \nconsumes chloride anions, the concentration of sodium cations also drops in the \nimmediate vicinity of the anode, because the solution has to remain \nelectroneutral. As a consequence, the brine concentration near the anode \ndecreases. When the region of lowered brine concentration reaches the membrane, \nmore water is transported to the cathode compartment as a result of \nelectroosmotic drag, which results in an increased swelling of the membrane and \nconsequently in an increased caustic crossover and lowered caustic current \nefficiency. The brine depletion can also cause increased oxygen evolution on \nthe anode. This reaction lowers chlorine current efficiency and generates \nhydronium cations. The increased generation of hydronium cations may result in \nan increase of membrane resistance as a result of protonation of the carboxylic \nlayer of the membrane. Detrimental effects of oxygen evolution on caustic \ncurrent efficiency can also be expected as a result of the increased transport \nof the hydronium cations through the membrane.\nWe have designed and tested four different anode modifications aimed at \nincreasing caustic current efficiency. In our standard cells, the anode meshes \nare pressed against the membrane and undesired effects resulting from both the \ngas blinding effect and the brine depletion may be expected. We expected both \neffects could be alleviated by slightly moving the anode reaction zone away \nfrom the membrane. Consequently, the first modification considered was \napplication of a suitable spacer between the membrane and the anode. \nUnfortunately, hot and wet chlorine is an extremely corrosive agent and not \nmany materials are expected to be compatible with it. As our all-glass anolyte \nrecirculation tanks containing hot brine and chlorine exhibited no signs of \ncorrosion after having worked for tens of thousands of hours, we selected glass \nas the material for the spacer. The first modified anode structure contained a \nrelatively loose glass fiber woven cloth as a spacer separating the anode and \nthe membrane. Unfortunately, quite contrarily to our expectations, the caustic \ncurrent efficiency for the modified cell was significantly lower than for the \nunmodified cell (see Table 3). In addition, the modification caused a \nsignificant increase of the cell voltage and erratic voltage-time behavior, as \nshown in Fig. 30. During the experiment, brine in the recirculation tank was \nslightly turbid and foaming. In addition, its acidity was very significantly \nincreased, as may be expected for significant contribution of the oxygen \nevolution in the overall anode reaction. When the experiment was discontinued \nafter merely 60 hours and the cell was disassembled, we found that the glass \ncloth was almost completely disintegrated. The corrosion of the cloth is deemed \nresponsible for the brine turbidity and foaming in the recirculation tank. \nWhile it is difficult to present the detailed mechanism of the glass fiber \ncorrosion, the following two reactions seem most likely: \n\n \n\nFigure 30. Significant increase of the cell voltage \nupon anode structure modification resulting from the use of the glass fiber \ncloth as a spacer between the anode and the membrane. Platinum catalyst loading \n0.5 mg/cm2. Temperature: 90oC. Brine concentration: 200 g/L. Oxygen pressure 20 \npsig. Humidification 0.5 cm3/min. Membrane 1. Panex\u00ae 30 carbon cloth spacer \nbetween the oxygen cathode and the membrane. \nThe above reactions may not occur with bulk glass, but they are more likely \nto occur with the glass fiber cloth, where the surface area to volume ratio is \nsignificantly higher.\nAs seen from equations 6 and 7, corrosion of the glass fibers cannot be \nresponsible for the increased brine acidity in this experiment. In fact, \nreaction 6 can actually lead to the opposite effect. As initially suspected, \nthe reason for the increased brine acidity is most likely the oxygen evolution \nprocess: 2 H2O --> O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e-\nWe suspect that the circulation of brine in the glass fiber cloth was \ninsufficient to maintain the desired brine concentration in the immediate \nvicinity of the anode surface. The brine concentration inside the spacer became \nquite low, which resulted in more significant oxygen evolution and brine \nacidification. The hydronium cations started being transported through the \nmembrane and protonated its carboxylic layer, which led to a significant \nincrease in the membrane resistance and thus also in the cell voltage (Fig. \n30). When the glass fiber cloth started disintegrating (eqs. 6 and 7), the \nbrine in the immediate vicinity of the membrane and the electrode could be more \neasily replaced with the fresh brine from the recirculation tank and when the \ncorrosion progressed, the cell started returning to more or less normal \noperation, as manifested by the gradual voltage decrease at 0.4 A/cm2 (Fig. 30).\n\nThree more anode modifications, hereafter called structures 3 through 5 \nwere studied. While all of them were based on a similar principle, they \nproduced different results. The modified structure 3 did not produce the \ndesired increase in caustic current efficiency. Up to the current density of \n0.6 A/cm2, the cell equipped with structure 3 generated sodium hydroxide with \nan efficiency that was almost identical to that obtained for the reference \nstructure (structure 1). At higher current densities, the current efficiency of \nthe cell equipped with structure 3 fell below that for the reference structure \n(Fig. 31). The structure 4 offered significant improvement over the reference \nstructure at all current densities (Fig. 31). Structure 4 was the only anode \nmodification that resulted in caustic current efficiencies matching the current \nindustrial standards for the membrane cells operating at standard current \ndensities (Fig. 31). Structure 5 did not improve the caustic current efficiency \nat low current densities (\u22650.4 A/cm2) and performed similarly to the \nreference structure and structure 3. However, it performed as well as structure \n4 at high current densities (\u22650.6 A/cm2). \nFigure 31. Effect \nof modification of the anode structure on caustic current efficiency.

Panex\u00ae 30 \ncarbon cloth spacer between the oxygen cathode and the membrane. \nThe changes in caustic current efficiency were not the only effects of the \nanode modifications. The cell voltage, another important performance \ncharacteristic, was also affected. Figure 32 shows the cell voltages for \ndifferent anode structures, measured at five different current densities during \nthe first 120 hours of the electrolysis. As seen from Fig. 32, all the anode \nmodifications led to some increase in the cell voltage. There was no \nstraightforward relationship between the measured cell voltages and the caustic \ncurrent efficiency. For instance, the highest voltages were typically observed \nfor structure 3, which did not improve the current efficiency, whereas the \nsecond highest voltages were observed for structure 4, which offered the \nlargest improvement in caustic current efficiency (Fig. 31). \n\nFigure 32. Effects of different anode structure modifications on the measured \ncell voltages during the first 120 hours of the cell operation. Platinum \ncatalyst loading 0.5 mg/cm2. Temperature: 90oC. Brine concentration: 200 g/L. \nOxygen pressure 20 psig. Humidification 0.5 cm3/min. Membrane 1. Panex\u00ae 30 \ncarbon cloth spacer between the oxygen cathode and the membrane. The voltage \nincrease for the structure 3 after ~110 hours resulted from an uncontrolled \nchange in brine concentration. \nIn order to assess feasibility of the anode modifications, we used the \nmethod applied previously when testing different membranes, which is based on \nthe changes in the energy efficiency of the electrolysis (eq. 5). The results \nare presented in Figure 33. \nFigure 33. Energy efficiency (see \neq. 5) of the cells equipped with different anode structures (see text) plotted \nversus current density. \nIt is clearly seen from Fig. 33 that structure 5 offers the lowest energy \nconsumption per unit weight of the product at high current densities (0.6-1.0 \nA/cm2), and thattructure 4 is the second best, whereas structure 3 is worse \nthan the reference. Due to their smaller absolute values, the differences in \nenergy efficiency at low current densities are not seen well in Fig. 33. The \nrelevant data are listed in Table 3. At the low current densities (0.2-0.4 A/cm2\n), the reference structure offers the lowest and the unworkable structure 2, \nthe highest energy consumption. The energy efficiency of the cells equipped \nwith the remaining structures does not follow exactly the same trend at 0.2 A/cm\n2 and 0.4 A/cm2 (Table 3), but the difference may result from experimental \nerror. \nTable 3. Performance characteristics of the cells \nequipped with different anode structures* \n4.3.6. Effects of Different Factors on Peroxide Generation Rate\nThe peroxide content in the sodium hydroxide generated was found to \nincrease with current density at both high (80% Pt, 5.0 mg/cm2) and low (20% \nPt, 0.5 mg/cm2) catalyst loading (Fig. 34). This effect is believed to \noriginate from the different kinetics of complete 4-electron reduction and \npartial 2-electron reduction of oxygen (eqs 2 and 3, section 3). The increase \nin current density shifts the cathode potential towards more negative values \nand affects the relative rates of peroxide and caustic generation. \nFig. 34. Effect of current density and Pt loading on peroxide \ngeneration. \nThe ratio of peroxide concentrations generated at high and low catalyst \nloadings is roughly independent of current density and its average value for \nthe plots in Fig.34 equals 4.5. The ratio of peroxide generation rates \nqualitatively correlates with the relative contents of Pt in catalytic layers \nof both electrodes and suggests that carbon and platinum particles compete as \noxygen reduction centers. While the numbers of electrons involved in the ORR on \nthe individual Pt and C particles and the respective efficiencies of peroxide \ngeneration are unknown, the literature data clearly demonstrate that gas \ndiffusion electrodes containing pure carbon in the catalyst layer produce \nsignificantly more peroxide than electrodes containing carbon supported Pt \ncatalysts [26,27,32,33,36].\nThe slightly higher overpotentials of the oxygen cathodes with low Pt \nloadings may also contribute to higher peroxide generation rates at low Pt \nloadings. The magnitude of this effect is rather small, since the observed \ndifferences in ohmic drop-corrected voltages amount to 0.05-0.08 V at 10 kA/m2.\n\nThe rate of peroxide generation depends on the electrolysis time. Peroxide \nconcentration changes occur in times of tens to hundreds of hours and depend on \nexperimental conditions. The typical dependence of peroxide concentration on \nelectrolysis time is shown in Fig. 35. \nFig. 35. Time effect on \nperoxide generation rate. Platinum loading: 0.5 mg/cm2. Current density: 10 kA/m\n2. \nWe believe that the observed increase of peroxide generation at constant \ncurrent density reflects the increasing role of carbon particles in oxygen \nreduction. The contribution from the carbon centers is likely to increase with \ntime in the presence of peroxide [4], oxygen, and hot and concentrated caustic. \nThese harsh conditions can lead to surface oxidation of the carbon particles \nand an increase of their hydrophilicity. Another likely reason for the more \nsignificant contribution of carbon in the cathode process and more significant \nperoxide generation is a loss of platinum surface area due to the agglomeration \nof Pt particles [31] and/or the loss of Pt particles due to the oxidative \ncorrosion of carbon carriers [3].\nAn increase in the hydrophilicity of the cathode was always observed when a \nlong experiment (from a few hundred to 2000 hours) was performed. Before the \nexperiment, the water contact angle on the catalyst side of the electrode was \naround 147\u00b0 and around 170\u00b0 on the gas diffusion layer side. After the \nelectrolysis, the contact angle was always below ~120\u00b0 on the catalyst side \nand below ~140\u00b0 on the gas diffusion layer side, but the measurement was \nquite inaccurate and the angle varied over the electrode surface. In the areas \nwhere the flow-field and gas diffusion layer remained in direct contact, the \ngas diffusion layer exhibited exceptionally elevated hydrophilicity, which was \neasily detected, when the electrode was rinsed with deionized water. The water \nfrequently adhered to the electrode in the areas of contact and formed a \npattern that was reproducing the geometry of the flow-field.\nThe measurement of the contact angle on the catalyst side was distorted by \nother phenomena. The prolonged electrolysis invariably resulted in the adhesion \nof the catalyst layer and the carbon cloth spacer. When the parts were being \nseparated, numerous carbon fibers were transferred to the catalyst layer and \nsome material from the catalyst layer was transferred to the carbon cloth. \nWhile the presence of the material from the catalyst layer on the hydrophilic \nspacer could be frequently seen with the naked eye, the presence of the carbon \nfibers on the electrode surface was detected using a microscope. Even though \nthe amount of material transferred from the catalyst layer to the spacer was \nrather small, no attempts were made to determine the quantity of platinum \npresent in the catalyst layer after electrolysis, since such an experiment was \nnot expected to help understanding the changes in peroxide generation rate at \n10 kA/m2. In accordance with the data obtained by Morimoto et al. [3], our \nprevious experiments, where the cells equipped with no spacer were used, \nfrequently indicated some catalyst loss during electrolysis. However, since the \nexperiments at current densities above 2-4 kA/m2 required \n\u201cconditioning\u201d of the membrane at lower current densities to prevent \nits possible damage at higher current densities, any platinum loss determined \nafter electrolysis always reflected the sum of losses at all the current \ndensities applied. Among them, the possible loss of platinum at 10 kA/m2 was \nexpected to be negligible [3] and masked by significantly larger losses \nresulting from the cell operation at lower current densities [3] during the \ninitial hours of electrolysis.\nExamination of the electrode after electrolysis under the microscope \nrevealed also numerous cracks in both the gas diffusion layer and the catalyst \nlayer. The number of cracks per unit surface area seemed to be higher on the \ncatalyst side of the electrode. An attempt was undertaken to determine, if \nperoxide was predominantly responsible for the loss of electrode \nhydrophobicity. Small pieces of ELAT\u00ae were placed in three beakers \ncontaining: deionized water, 31 % (weight) sodium hydroxide, and 31 % (weight) \nsodium hydroxide with as high as possible quantity of peroxide added. The \ntemperature of the solutions was maintained at approximately 90\u00baC. \nUnfortunately, due to fast peroxide decomposition, the experiment required \nfrequent additions of peroxide and for this reason it could not be continued \nbeyond eight hours. After such a short time, none of the samples exhibited any \nmeaningful change in the contact angle. We believe that the observed increase \nof peroxide generation at constant current density reflects the increasing role \nof carbon particles in oxygen reduction.\nThe effect of brine concentration on peroxide production was studied at a \ncurrent density of 10 kA/m2 for times longer than 500 hours after a \nsteady-state peroxide generation rate was reached (Fig. 35). Brine \nconcentration was adjusted by modifying the fresh brine supply to the \nrecirculation tank. It usually took around an hour for the brine concentration \nto reach its steady-state level. For the purposes of hydroxide and peroxide \nanalysis, samples of the caustic were taken after an additional one half to one \nhour after the brine concentration stabilized.\nFigure 36 shows the effect of brine concentration on the composition of the \nNaOH solution generated. An increase of brine concentration from 136 to 228 g/dm\n3 produces an increase in NaOH concentration from around 26.5% to a little more \nthan 31%. The peroxide content in the solution increases even faster, as \nmanifested by approximately 25% increase of the peroxide-to-hydroxide molar \nratio. The effect of brine on peroxide generation most likely results from \nchanges in water activity at the oxygen reduction site caused by the NaOH \nconcentration changes. \nFig. 36. Effect of brine concentration \non peroxide generation rate and NaOH concentration. Platinum loading: 0.5 mg/cm2\n. Current density: 1.0 A/cm2. \nThe effect of brine strength on NaOH concentration most likely results from \nchanges in the membrane swelling. At lower brine concentrations, the membrane \nis more swelled and more permeable than at higher concentrations. As a \nconsequence, more water is transported through the membrane [37] yielding lower \ncaustic concentration. A more quantitative measure of the degree of membrane \nswelling and permeability is its resistance, which increases about 7% for the \nmeasured increase in brine concentration. As could be expected, the caustic \ncurrent efficiency also increases with the brine concentration as a result of a \ndecreased caustic crossover (Fig. 37). \nFig. 37. Effect of \nbrine concentration on membrane resistance and caustic current efficiency. \nPlatinum loading: 0.5 mg/cm2. Current density: 10 kA/m2. \nOne may also suspect partial oxygen evolution [38] on the DSA\u00ae anode to \ncontribute to the above phenomena (Figures 36 and 37). This reaction produces \nhydronium cations and its relative contribution to the measured current \nincreases with the decrease in brine concentration [38]. The increase in the \nbrine acidity may produce an increased H3O+ flux across the membrane, which may \nresult in a lower membrane resistance, lower current efficiency, and lower NaOH \nconcentration. Such an explanation would be plausible for a sulfonated \nmembrane, which behaves like a strong electrolyte in both the acid and the \nsodium salt form and its conductivity correlates with the molar conductivities \nof hydronium and sodium ions [39]. The picture seems more complex in the \npresent case. As the carboxylic layer of the bi-layer membrane behaves like a \nweak electrolyte when in the protonated form, the net effect of the enhanced \noxygen evolution and the increased brine acidity may be opposite to the effect \nobserved. Consequently, the effect of brine concentration on the extent of \nmembrane swelling offers a better explanation of the effects shown in Figures \n36 and 37.\nThe significant change in oxygen humidification level from 0 to almost 6 cm3\n/min decreases the peroxide-to-hydroxide molar ratio by approximately 10%. At \nthe same time, caustic concentration drops from 31.6% to 12.6%, i.e., much more \nthan observed in the experiments where the brine concentration effects were \nstudied (see above). \nFig. 38. Comparison of effects of oxygen \nstream humidification and brine concentration on peroxide generation rate. \nPlatinum loading: 0.5 mg/cm2. Current density: 10 kA/m2. \nQuantitative comparison of the humidification and brine concentration \neffects on peroxide formation is shown in Fig. 38. Here, the molar ratio of \nperoxide-to-hydroxide is plotted against NaOH concentration, which is a common \nmeasure of the quantity of water introduced into the cathode compartment either \nby transport from the anode compartment through the membrane or by direct \nhumidification of the oxygen stream. The much weaker effect of the direct \nhumidification of oxygen (Fig. 38) indicates that most of the humidification \nwater does not reach the catalyst layer and thus affects neither the \ncomposition of the liquid phase at the reaction site nor the membrane \npermeability. The main effect of oxygen humidification is the diluting of the \nNaOH solution that already left the electrode. \nFig. 39. \nChanges of chloride and peroxide concentrations in caustic soda during the \nfirst 300 hours of cell operation at 1.0 A/cm2. \nFigure 39 presents time dependencies for the concentrations of chloride and \nperoxide in the NaOH solution generated at 1.0 A/cm2 during the first 300 hours \nof cell operation. During this time the most significant changes in peroxide \nconcentration occur (Fig. 35). At the same time, the chloride content does not \nvary, except for the first 20 hours at 1.0 A/cm2 (between 50 and 70 hours after \nthe start of electrolysis), where the membrane may not have attained its steady \nstate permeability. These results demonstrate the insignificance of the \nchloride effect on peroxide generation.\nThe hydrophilic spacer significantly reduces peroxide generation (Fig. 40).\n \nFigure. 40. Effect of the hydrophilic spacer on peroxide \ngeneration rate. Gold-plated cathode hardware. Panex\u00ae 30 carbon cloth used \nas the hydrophilic spacer. \nWe believe that the presence of spacer reduces the likelihood of carbon \nparticles participating in the oxygen reduction in two ways. First of all, \nsince the spacer acts as an efficient drain for the NaOH solution [12], the \nquantity of NaOH remaining inside the electrode decreases and the corrosion of \ncarbon particles is less likely to occur. Secondly, without the spacer, the \ncatholyte can accumulate in the pores of the Pt catalyst-free gas diffusion \nlayer, and the partial reduction of oxygen may occur on carbon particles inside \nthe gas diffusion layer.\nHydrogen peroxide in alkaline medium (HO2-) is typically regarded as very \nunstable. Since the decomposition of peroxide is catalyzed by trace impurities, \nthe fact that the peroxide generated in our cells survives in spite of the \nunfavorable conditions in the cathode compartment, i.e., the strongly alkaline \nenvironment and the high temperature, can be associated with the high purity of \nthe NaOH solutions generated. However, a variety of solid surfaces or surface \ndefects can act as peroxide decomposition centers. Consequently, an effect of \nthe cathode hardware coating on the peroxide generation rate was also studied \n(Fig. 41). \nFigure 41. Comparison of peroxide generation rates \nin cells equipped with gold- and silver-plated hardware. Peroxide \nconcentrations expressed in millimoles of peroxide per kilogram of liquid \ncaustic. Platinum catalyst loading 0.5 mg/cm2. Membrane 1. Panex\u00ae 30 carbon \ncloth spacer between the oxygen cathode and the membrane. \nDuring electrolysis, the potential of the cathode hardware parts is \ndetermined by the kinetics of oxygen reduction on the gas diffusion electrode, \nwhich has much higher active surface area than the hardware parts. While this \npotential, together with intrinsic properties of the cathode hardware coating, \ndetermine the rate of electrochemical decomposition of peroxide on the surface \nof cathode hardware parts, the final peroxide concentration in the caustic \nstream is determined by the relative rates of peroxide generation by the oxygen \ndiffusion cathode and its destruction by the coating of the hardware parts. As \nthe rates of peroxide generation in the cells equipped with identical oxygen \ndiffusion cathodes under identical experimental conditions are the same, \ndifferences in measured peroxide levels reflect relative ability of the \ndifferent hardware coatings to decompose peroxide by-product. Figure 41 shows \nconcentration of peroxide generated in two cells equipped with gold plated and \nsilver plated hardware under comparable conditions.\nAt low current densities (0.2-0.4 A/cm2), the cell equipped with silver \nplated hardware was found to produce less peroxide byproduct. The opposite \nsituation was true for high current densities (0.8-1.0 A/cm2), i.e., less \nperoxide was detected in the caustic product generated in the cell equipped \nwith the gold plated hardware.\nOne of the expected benefits of using unsupported catalysts (section \n4.3.3.) was elimination of the peroxide generation. The experiments revealed \nthat removal of carbon support from the catalyst layer reduced the unwanted \nbyproduct. However, no complete peroxide elimination was achieved, even when \nthe most potent oxygen reduction catalyst, i.e., pure platinum was used. This \nfinding implies that either the oxygen reduction on platinum does not occur \ncompletely according to the four-electron mechanism (eq. 2) under the \nexperimental conditions applied or the carbon-containing gas diffusion layer \ncontributes to the overall reduction current and is at least partially \nresponsible for the peroxide generation. Simultaneous occurrence of both \nphenomena is also possible.\nThe results shown in Fig. 42 suggest that the gas diffusion layers in cells \nequipped with the MEA-type cathodes can participate in the oxygen reduction and \nbe responsible for some peroxide generation. As demonstrated above (see section \n4.3.3.), the single-sided gas diffusion layer is more likely to get partially \nflooded by NaOH solution. The partial flooding of the gas diffusion layer \nfacilitates formation of the three-phase boundary involving the carbon \nparticles in the gas diffusion layer, oxygen and NaOH solution and thus creates \nsuitable conditions for participation of the gas diffusion layer in the overall \nreduction current. The lower rate of peroxide generation in the cell equipped \nwith the more hydrophobic, double-sided GDL (Fig. 42) remains in accord with \nthe above hypothesis. \nFigure 42.

Membrane 2.\n \nThe MEA-type cathodes containing both the pure ruthenium and the mixed \nplatinum/ruthenium catalyst produced significantly less peroxide than the pure \nplatinum catalyst and the peroxide concentration decreased in the order: Pt \n> Ru > Pt/Ru. Consequently, the mixed Pt/Ru catalyst was found to be most \nefficient in destroying the unwanted byproduct. The highest peroxide \nconcentration detected for a ruthenium-based catalyst was 0.12 mmol/kg at 1.0 \nA/cm2 after approximately 160 hours of electrolysis in the cell, where the pure \nruthenium was used (see also Fig. 42).\nThe low concentrations of peroxide generated in the cells which utilized \nthe ruthenium-based catalysts, most probably originates from catalytic action \nof ruthenates on the peroxide decomposition reaction, as confirmed by the \nresults of simple test tube experiments. Moreover, the relative quantities of \nperoxide generated in the cells utilizing the Pt/Ru and Ru catalysts inversely \ncorrelated with the amounts of ruthenium present in the respective NaOH \nsolutions (see Fig. 24).\nIn order to eliminate the peroxide from the product stream, the cathode \ndesign and structure were modified. The first modification, hereafter called \nthe modified cathode structure 1, resulted in a very substantial decrease of \nthe peroxide generation rate. The results obtained for the modified cathode are \nshown in Fig. 43 (above) together with the typical results obtained for the \nstandard ELAT cathode equipped with the hydrophilic spacer. As easily seen, the \nmodified structure 1 is especially efficient in destroying peroxide at high \ncurrent densities, which are targeted by the new technology. While the rate of \nperoxide generation by all the cathodes studied previously significantly \nincreased with current density, an opposite trend was observed for the modified \nstructure (Fig. 43). \nFig. 43. Peroxide generation rates in the \ncells equipped with the modified cathode structure 1 (see text) and with \nstandard ELAT cathode and hydrophilic spacer (Panex 30). Gold-plated cathode \nhardware. Catalyst: 5.0 mg/cm2 Pt. The even numbers denote current densities in \nA/cm2. Gold-plated cathode hardware used. \nAs opposed to all cathode structures studied previously, peroxide \nconcentrations generated by the modified cathode structure were consistently \nlow during long-term cell operation approaching 2 months (Fig. 44). \nFigure 44. Effects of long time cell operation on peroxide generation \nrate in a cell equipped with the modified cathode structure 1 (see text).\n \nThe cell equipped with modified cathode structure 1 exhibited slightly \nhigher voltages than the cell equipped with the standard ELAT cathode and no \nhydrophilic spacer. The cell voltage increase (Fig. 45) is considered a \nrelatively small penalty for the negligible peroxide generation. \nFigure 45.

Modified structure 1 : HFR (red) , Voltage \n(blue) . \nA series of experiments was performed to elucidate the effects of extreme \nconditions on the overall performance of structure 1. The experiments revealed \nthat the new cathode was more susceptible to flooding than the cathode \nstructures used previously. Figure 46 shows the changes in the observed cell \nvoltage brought about by changes in the oxygen flow rate. \n\nFigure 46. Effects of change of experimental conditions on performance of the \ncell equipped with the modified cathode structure 1. Red arrows indicate times \nwhen the oxygen flow rate was changed.

Green arrow \nmarks termination of the experiment. Temperature: 90oC. Brine concentration: \n200 g/dm3. Current density: 1.0 A/cm2. \nAs shown in Fig. 46, a change in experimental conditions lead to the \nvoltage instability and eventually to its significant increase. The voltage \nincrease was found to be irreversible, since returning to the previous \nexperimental conditions did not result in lowering of the cell voltage (Fig. \n46). Some improvement was noted after temporarily discontinuing the \nelectrolysis and flushing the system with pure water under nitrogen, but no \ncomplete recovery was observed. This behavior was quite consistent with the \nflooding phenomenon. \nFigure 47. Dependence of peroxide \ngeneration rate on the oxygen flow rate for the modified cathode structure 1 \n(see text). \nFig. 47 demonstrates rather complex character of the effect of oxygen flow \nrate on peroxide generation. The presence of a maximum in the plot suggests \nopposite influence from at least two different factors. When the inlet oxygen \nflow rate becomes low, i.e., close to that required by the stoichiometry of \n4-electron oxygen reduction (eq. 2), the outlet pressure in the cell drops \nbelow the preset value of 20 psig, as there is unsatisfactory supply of the gas \nto the cell. As a result of the pressure drop, the relative kinetics of the \n4-electron and 2-electron oxygen reduction processes (eqs. 2 and 3) are likely \nto change, which can result in smaller quantities of peroxide generated. The \ndecrease of the peroxide generation rate at significantly higher rates of \noxygen flow most likely results from the effect of gas flow on the \neffectiveness of caustic removal from the electrode. High gas velocity in the \ncathode chamber makes the removal of caustic from the electrode pores easier.\n \nFigure 48. Estimate of the limits of safe cell operation from \nhydrogen evolution in a deliberately flooded cell equipped with the modified \ncathode structure 1. Temperature: 90oC. Brine concentration: 200 g/dm3.\n\nShorter residence time of NaOH inside the electrode lowers the likelihood \nof carbon participating as the oxygen reduction catalyst and thus also the \nperoxide generation rate. Moreover, under such conditions, water from the \nhumidifier has better access to the electrode pores, which may lead to a \ndecrease of caustic concentration at the reaction site and an effect similar to \nthe effect of brine concentration on peroxide generation may result.\nSince electrode flooding reduces the number of catalyst particles available \nfor oxygen reduction, flooded electrodes are likely to generate hydrogen, which \ncan create rather dangerous conditions. In order to assess limits of safe \nelectrolysis, one of the cells was deliberately flooded and hydrogen content in \nthe exhaust oxygen stream was monitored at different current densities. Figure \n48 (above) shows a plot of the hydrogen content versus the cell voltage \ncorrected for the ohmic drop.\nLinear extrapolation of the plot in Fig. 48 towards the low voltages gives \nan estimate of the corrected cell voltage, where virtually no hydrogen is \nproduced.\nThe estimated value of the onset of hydrogen evolution (2.125 V) can be \nused to determine the highest operating current density for a cathode with the \nidentical catalyzed layer as long as the cell voltage corrected for ohmic \nlosses is known. The result of such a determination for the standard cell \nequipped with the hydrophilic spacer is shown in Fig. 49. Since the actual \nfraction of the current that produces hydrogen increases with the degree of \nflooding, the highest operational current density for the cell with no flooding \ncan be even higher than ~2.7 A/cm2, the value obtained from the linear \nextrapolation of the plot shown in Fig. 49. \nFigure 49. \nDetermination of the highest operating current density from the onset of \nhydrogen evolution in a cell with the flooded cathode.

Panex 30 spacer. \nFurther modifications of the cathode structure were introduced to reduce \nits susceptibility to flooding and still maintain the low peroxide generation \nrates. The modification resulted in an improvement of the flooding \ncharacteristics. However, the performance of the modified structure, hereafter \ncalled modified structure 2, was found to deteriorate over time in terms of \nboth peroxide generation rate (Fig. 50) and cell voltage stability. \nFigure 50. Peroxide generation in a cell equipped with the modified \ncathode structure 2. \nMost promising ways to improve the overall performance of modified \nstructure 2 were determined and are planned to be implemented in the future.\nAccomplishments\n\nEffects of Operating Conditions on Selected Performance Characteristics of \nOxygen-Depolarized Chlor-Alkali Cell by L.Lipp, S.Gottesfeld, J.Chlistunoff, \nCentennial Meeting of the Electrochemical Society, Philadelphia, May 2002\nZero-Gap Chlor-Alkali Cell With Oxygen-Consuming Cathode.

At the standard industrial current densities (\u2264 0.4 A/cm2), \nthe oxygen-depolarized cells produce caustic with current efficiencies matching \ncurrent industrial norms for membrane cells but at significantly lower voltages \nand thus with substantial energy savings. The cells can also be operated at \nsignificantly higher current densities (up to 1.0 A/cm2).\nThe best overall cell performance was obtained when carbon supported \nplatinum was used as the oxygen reduction catalyst. The shortcomings of carbon \nas the catalyst support include its insufficient corrosion resistance in \noxygenated caustic and the involvement in peroxide generation. We demonstrated \nthat peroxide generation can be virtually eliminated by proper cathode design. \nHowever, the poor corrosion resistance of carbon reduces the cathode \ndurability. Cathode corrosion significantly decreases with the increase in \ncurrent density and it is most likely negligible at 1.0 A/cm2, but operating \nthe cell at lower current densities and (especially) unexpected power outages \ncan lead to substantial losses of the precious metal catalyst.\nThe MEA-type electrodes utilizing unsupported catalysts offer excellent \ncorrosion resistance during power outages. However, they operate at \nsignificantly higher voltages and consequently they reduce the energy savings. \nMoreover, they do not guarantee the elimination of peroxide as long as \ncarbon-containing gas diffusion layers are used.\nThe catalyst loss under open circuit conditions can be avoided by \nautomatically applying cathode-protecting conditions, e.g., flushing the \ncathode compartment with an inert gas, etc., but the same method cannot be \napplied when the cell is being operated.\nTwo ways of alleviating the problem seem most obvious. As the precious \nmetal catalyst most likely participates in the oxidative corrosion of carbon \ncarriers by forming local micro-cells involving carbon particles, using a less \nprecious metal as the catalyst may be a feasible alternative. Although worse \nthan that of platinum, the catalytic activity of silver is non-negligible under \nthe industrial conditions and the corrosion resistance of cathodes utilizing \ncarbon-supported silver was shown to be better than those utilizing the \ncarbon-supported platinum. Metal alloys, such as for example Ag93Pt7 [32], are \na promising alternative to the expensive platinum.\nAnother way of solving the cathode corrosion problem may involve \nalternative catalyst supports, which will exhibit better corrosion resistance \nin the oxygenated NaOH solution.\nThe more detailed summary of the most important technical results obtained \nis presented below:\n\nZero-gap chlor-alkali cells with oxygen-depolarized cathodes offer very \nsignificant energy savings versus the conventional membrane cells equipped with \nhydrogen-evolving cathodes. The documented savings reach as much as 38% at 0.31 \nA/cm2.\nThe zero-gap cells of our design with the modified anode structure \ngenerate caustic soda with current efficiency above 96% at standard industrial \ncurrent densities (= 0.4 A/cm2). These current efficiencies match or exceed the \ncurrent norms for conventional industrial membrane cells. At higher current \ndensities (0.6 A/cm2 = j = 1.0 A/cm2), the current efficiency exceeds 90-94% \ndepending on current density.\nDue to the smaller water consumption by the oxygen reduction process as \ncompared to the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen-depolarized cathodes offer \nmore favorable conditions for membrane operation and allow higher current \ndensity operation with a smaller risk of ohmic overheating of the membrane.\nThe magnitude of the effects of oxygen humidification on the cell voltage \nand caustic current efficiency is predominantly determined by the relative \namounts of water introduced to the cathode compartment with oxygen and through \nthe membrane from the anode compartment, as well as by the cell design. The \noptimum level of humidification, which guarantees the best overall cell \nperformance, depends on the cell design, the membrane used and the operating \nconditions, e.g., the current density.\nOf the chlor-alkali membranes tested, membrane 4 offers the highest energy \nefficiency at the highest current densities (0.8-1.0 A/cm2), membrane 3 is the \nsecond best, while membrane 1 performs noticeably poorer. At lower current \ndensities (0.2-0.6 A/cm2), the performance of these three membranes is very \ncomparable. The older chlor-alkali membrane (membrane 2), performs \nsignificantly worse than the remaining membranes at all current densities.\nThe unwanted byproduct of the cathode reaction, peroxide, is predominantly \nformed as a result of the oxygen reduction on carbon particles present in both \nthe catalyst and the gas diffusion layer of the standard ELAT\u00ae electrode. \nConsequently, peroxide is not eliminated in the cells equipped with the \nmembrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) containing unsupported catalyst and the \nseparate gas diffusion layer containing carbon particles.\nLoss of hydrophobicity of carbon particles is responsible for the increase \nof peroxide generation with the electrolysis time\nLow water activity at the reaction site promotes formation of peroxide.\n\nElimination of peroxide from the caustic product stream was possible by \nmodifying the cathode structure. However, the modified structure was more \nsusceptible to flooding.\nCathode hardware coating affects peroxide generation rate. The gold plated \nhardware destroys peroxide more efficiently at high current densities (0.8-1.0 \nA/cm2), whereas the silver plated hardware helps destroy peroxide at low \ncurrent densities (0.2-0.4 A/cm2).\nSilver plated cathode hardware exhibits an excellent corrosion resistance \nboth under open circuit conditions and during electrolysis.\nThe products of sodium chloride oxidation, i.e., elemental chlorine, \nchlorate, hypochlorite, etc., contribute to the cathode hardware corrosion \nduring uncontrolled interruptions of electrolysis and are also likely to cause \ncatalyst loss from electrodes utilizing carbon supported platinum catalyst.\nMembrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs) containing unsupported platinum \ncatalyst offer excellent performance stability and exhibit excellent corrosion \nresistance during uncontrolled power outages, when the membrane remains in \ncontact with concentrated brine.\nThe degree of catalyst utilization in the MEA is significantly lower than \nin the cathode utilizing the carbon-supported catalyst with the same nominal \nloading.\nProlonged contact of the MEA with water leads to significant delamination \nof the catalyst layer and the membrane. The increased and uneven swelling of \nthe membrane and the Nafion binder is suspected to be a major factor \nresponsible for the delamination.\nExtended power outages result in significant lowering of caustic current \nefficiency, especially when the cell is equipped with the hydrophilic spacer. \nThe origin of this phenomenon is unclear. \nEvery new laboratory-scale technology requires a scale-up and eventually \ntesting in a pilot plant, before it may be implemented. The conclusions \nsummarized in this report pertain to small laboratory-scale cells and may turn \nout to be incorrect in the case of industrial-scale cells, where the electrode \nsurface areas are at least two orders of magnitude larger. For instance, the \ncurrent distribution over the membrane surface is uniform in the small cell, \nwhereas it may be non-uniform in a larger cell because of the more demanding \nconditions of supplying the reagents to and removing the products from the \nreaction site in the latter case. Correcting the problem may require adjusting \nof the operating conditions, changing the hardware design or even installing \nadditional hardware. Consequently, the scale-up stage will be an extremely \nimportant part of the research before the technology can be tested in a pilot \nplant and eventually implemented. However, an ordinary research laboratory \ncannot handle currents in excess of 100 A, which limits the size of the test \ncell to twice the size of the cells used in our study. This size is probably \ntoo small to provide reliable evaluation of the scale-up effects on the cell \noperation.\nConsequently, the scale-up phase of the research must involve an industrial \npartner, who can perform the necessary testing of the scaled-up cells in their \nresearch facility. The industrial partner can also provide the high purity \nbrine, which is hard to find on the market. Some manufacturers sell the brine, \nbut in quantities that significantly exceed the needs of a research project. On \nthe other hand, the quantity of brine used by our project, amounted to \napproximately 42 dm3 (11 gal) per day, when two cells were operated at 1.0 A/cm2\n. Such a quantity is too large to be processed in a research laboratory using a \ncomplex multi-step purification procedure, unless there is a separate \npurification system in place. However, the cost of the purification system and \nits maintenance may be prohibitively high given the volume of brine processed.\n\nThe best possible combination of industrial partners should involve a \nchlor-alkali producer and a chlor-alkali cell manufacturer. The collaboration \nwith a chlor-alkali manufacturer is more desired from the standpoint of ongoing \nresearch because of the extent of services they can provide to the research \nteam on a daily basis, e.g., brine supply, sample analysis, consultation, etc. \nThe collaboration with a chlor-alkali cell manufacturer can be particularly \nhelpful, when the technology development approaches the commercialization stage.\n\nAcknowledgements\nFinancial support from the Industrial Technologies Program of the DOE is \ngratefully acknowledged.\nMany thanks are due Sara Dillich and Mike Soboroff, DOE Program Managers \nand to Tom Baker and Melissa Miller, LANL Program Managers for their continuous \nsupport and interest in this research.\nStudent researchers Sarah Stellingwerf and Amanda Casteel were involved \npart time in this research.

Then lets change the way we work\n The number of people killed at work has risen by almost 20% over the past \nyear, according to Health and Safety Executive figures. A similar pattern \nemerged in the new serious accident statistics, with a rise in the rate of \nmajor injuries in every industrial sector, and the overall figure up by well \nover 60% to 28,040. Figures show a disproportionate increase in the number of \nself-employed fatalities, reflecting the increase in numbers of vulnerable \ncasual or contract workers.\n It is estimated that a third of all ill-health is due to work. Ill-health \nis increasing with new technology, new chemicals and a general worsening in \nworking conditions. Health and safety can no longer be just seen as the domain \nof the industrial worker. The new type of worker now sits at a computer or \nanswers the telephone all day, perhaps in the same space as hundreds of others. \nThe health problems we face \u2014 limb disorder, eye strain, lack of fresh \nair, lack of space, lack of breaks \u2014 may appear different from \ntraditional health and safety concerns but many are really no different and no \nless damaging than those that workers in sweatshops have been facing since the \nbeginning of the 19th century.\n Taking up health and safety issues at work can be a daunting prospect. The \nwhole area is a confusing mass of regulations, procedures and law. But health \nand safety remains a major issue for many of us, and things are getting worse \nin many workplaces. Below, we look at just a few of the health and safety \nproblems you might come up against. We focus on the problems that modern \nworkforces suffer, now that service, care and office-based industries have \nincreased. We also look at how you can use the law to help you and suggest \nwhere you might go to for information. Most importantly, we also look at how \nyou can start getting things changed with health and safety, with an eye to the \nfact that ultimately the only true healthy and safe workplace can be one which \nus the workers run ourselves.\nHealth hazards\n Health hazards are often not immediately obvious and some are virtually \ninvisible. Take a typical office work example. Bad design and poor maintenance \nin modern sealed workplaces with their artificial environments can be \nresponsible for allergies, exhaustion, depression, asthma and other respiratory \nillness, eye problems and infections such as humidifier fever. Keyboard workers \nare suffering an epidemic in Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), a term grouping \ntogether a number of Upper Limb Disorders. It currently affects 200,000 workers \na year in Britain, many of whom are in constant pain and disabled, sometimes \npermanently. RSI also affects manual workers in all kinds of repetitive jobs \n\u2014 food, electronics, clothing, cars, packing, care work, cleaning, \nfurniture and many other industries. Many workers realise the danger too late, \nand become disabled. Photocopiers and laser printers give off Ozone, which can \ncause health problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation, dermatitis, \nheadaches, premature ageing and possible reproductive and cancer hazards. The \never increasing use of computers also subjects up to 10 million UK workers to a \nrange of possible hazards \u2014 eyestrain, RSI, skin problems, miscarriages, \nstressful work organisation.\n Occupational Stress in areas such as office work, social work, care work, \nnursing education etc. is now widespread and growing, not least because of \nincreasing casualisation of work in these areas, and the added pressures this \nbrings. Staffing cuts, increased workload, long hours of work, the pressure of \ncaring for or supporting increasingly poor and deprived people with very few \nresources or service; all lead to stress both in and out of work. As cuts bite, \nand new, more hierarchical, systems are imposed in workplaces, the tendency for \nmanagers to harass and bully workers into increasing their workload becomes \ngreater. Workplace bullying (99% of the time by managers) has also become a \nrecognised workplace problem. All leads to more stress, which can result in \nstomach and heart disease and a variety of psychological illnesses. It is \nrelated to increased accident rates, relationship problems, absenteeism and \nincreased drug and alcohol use. The most extreme effect of stress is sudden \ndeath i.e. people working themselves to death.\n These health problems, many of which have long been documented, are now \nwidely recognised as legitimate health and safety concerns. This is a start, \nbut some employers are still denying even the existence of major work-related \nhealth problems. As if to compound the conspiracy, the Government has been \ncovering up the problem, if the Health Department's suppression of a 1995 \nreport it had commissioned from Manchester University is anything to go by. The \nfindings included the warning that people who work a 48 hour week double their \nchance of heart attack. The Government at the time was contesting in the \nEuropean court the Directive of an imposed maximum 48 hour week, on the grounds \nthat it was nothing to do with health and safety. Unfortunately, the level of \nsanctions against employers for injury remains pitiful. Out of the 29,000 \ninjuries and over 3,000 deaths of workers in 1993-4, there were only 1,507 \nconvictions under Health and Safety law and the average penalty was only 3,061 \npounds. And getting convictions for non-accident health effects is even more \ndifficult; health risks take time to become evident, as the effects are usually \ncumulative and delayed. The effects are chronic rather that acute. These \nproblems are notoriously prone to abuse by bosses. Increasingly, workers are \nfinding themselves sacked after being off due to a work-related health problem.\n\nThe law\n To get to grips with Health and Safety you need to have some knowledge of \nwhat the law says and how it can affect you. It's a bit of a minefield, and the \nbest up-to-date and jargon-free interpretation is the Labour Research \nDepartment (LRD) guides (see reading stuff). But it is also important, if \npossible, to keep track of new directives, regulations and legislation, which \nare now coming in, either directly or indirectly, from the European Parliament. \nLRD also covers such issues in their monthly magazine \u201cLabour \nResearch\u201d.\n One important area starting point is Common Law which includes the \ncontract of employment, which imposes duties on management and worker. \nManagement has a \u201cduty of care\u201d to workers, and may be sued if they \nneglect this (see \u201cAt a glance\u201d). TUC unions put large resources \ninto compensation claims for breach of this contract. Statute law applies to \nspecific points of health which have been introduced since the 1840's, \nbeginning with the Factory Acts, leading up to the Health and Safety at Work \nAct 1974 (HSW Act). The latter is a major Act, and is summarised in the LRD \npamphlet, Health and Safety Law. This Act sets out the broad general duty on \nemployers to maintain places of work so they are safe and without risks to \nhealth.\n European Directives come from the 1987 Single European Act (SEA) which \nlaid down general duties and minimum standards. In Britain, this has resulted \nin the Management and Safety at Work Regulations, 1992 (Management Regs). These \nmake it much clearer what employers must do to comply with their duties set out \nin the HSW Act. The central feature is risk assessment, which is the procedure \na boss needs to follow to decide what health and safety measures are suitable \nand sufficient. However, there is a potential problem here for the workforce \n\u2014 in getting compensation. To win compensation it has to be proved that \nmanagement didn't follow their own procedures. If management have conducted a \ntoken risk assessment, and informed workers of the hazards, they can sit back \nwith the secure knowledge that whatever happens to workers in the future, they \nhave done their duty under the law, and so probably can't be touched.\n Another potential problem with the SEA is the appointment of Employee \nHealth and Safety Representatives. Where there is no recognised trade union, \n\u201cemployee representation\u201d is invariably organised by management, \nthus by-passing the involvement of workers, in much the same way as European \nworks councils do.\nGetting started\n Raising Health and Safety as a long-term workplace issue cannot be done \nalone. Like any workplace issue, a strong, organised workforce who are prepared \nto take action to force management to act is essential. Health and safety has \nnormally most effectively been dealt with within union organisational \nstructures, so that all workers have the information they need and can act on \nit collectively as they see fit. Without union organisation, health and safety \nis better as part of a general strategy of building organisation and \nconfidence. And it is an issue that can provide a focus around which a group of \nworkers can act together and rapidly gain a bit of collective confidence.\nUnionised workplace\n If you are in a recognised union, in theory, you have a number of clear \nrights (see At a glance). Reality is often different. Like any other workplace \nissue organisational strength is a basic requirement both to prevent \nvictimisation of reps and to push management to make improvements over specific \nissues. Ideally, reps should get an office, access to telephone and fax, time \noff with pay to attend union training, and use of a suitable room for meeting \nwith and reporting back to members.\nNo union, or as good as\n There are more and more non-unionised, casual workforces where even \nminimum standards of health and safety are ignored by management. This makes it \ntough to start, but not impossible; there can even be advantages in starting \nfrom scratch. If there are no clear management-run structures to deal with \nhealth and safety, this makes things a lot clearer. And if workers, recognise \nthat they are the ones who can identify problems and can force change, then \nconfidence can be gathered around the health and safety issue.\n Whether you are in a recognised union or not, the first step for dealing \nwith a health and safety issue is to establish what the problem is and how it \nis affecting workers. This can be done through questionnaire, inspection, or \n\u201cunofficial\u201d documentation by means of a diary or record book. You \ncan get model questionnaires or suggested checklists for inspections from most \nunions, or devise your own. An inspection can consist of simply taking \nstatements from each worker about a particular problem, and how it is affecting \nthem.\nCourses\n The next step is to find out what your boss should be doing about it. The \nbest way to acquaint yourself with the main hazards and issues is to get on a \ntrade union health and safety course. Most unions run these, although some are \nusing management courses. Nevertheless, it is a good way to meet other stewards \nor union reps, and find out where you can get information. If you are in a \nunion, you can get a list of courses from your branch office, and they will \ngive you advice on the best way of approaching your employer to have time off \n(you should get paid for this). Otherwise, the LRD has a list of local \nresources/hazard centres up and down the country. The next step is to meet as a \ngroup.\nCutting through the jargon\n Employers, Government and bodies like the HSE traditionally try to diffuse \nhealth and safety issues into \u201cnon-conflict\u201d issues around \ntraining, perpetrating the \u201ccareless worker\u201d myth \u2014 that if \nonly workers would be more careful there would not be as many accidents. And \nthey will try and individualise problems, putting the onus on the workers to \nchange rather than doing anything about the workplace. For instance, workers \nhave witnessed and documented the epidemic in occupational stress of the past \nfew years. The Labour Research Department and the public service workers' \nunion, UNISON, have published a booklet on Stress. Even the HSE have brought \nout a glossy booklet on the subject. The main response of the HSE and employers \nto the issue has been to recommend stress management measures such as \ncounselling, thus making it the individual workers' responsibility, and taking \nthe onus of the problem away from the workplace itself. If workers are \nsuffering stress what needs to be done collectively to change the workplace? \nThe answer is to do with conditions of work.\n Another example is management attitudes to hazardous substances, as \ncovered by The Control of Hazardous Substances to Health (COSHH) Regulations, \n1989. Employers must carry out a COSHH assessment by a trained and \n\u201ccompetent person\u201d (the HSE have produced guidance on this). To \ncontrol or prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals employers must work through \na hierarchy of measures: 1. Elimination of the hazard; 2. Substitution with a \nless hazardous substance; 3. Control measures such as exhaust ventilation, and; \n4. protective clothing.\n To eliminate the risk of a hazardous substance it must be got rid of. As \nthe HSE say, \u201cin all cases prevention or adequate control of exposure \nshould be achieved by means other than personal protective clothing, so far as \nis reasonably practicable\u201d. Like most other situations, how \n\u201cpractical\u201d this is depends on how much money your boss will spend \non safety. In reality, for instance with asbestos, employers , instead of \ngetting rid of the dangerous substance altogether, will try to control it or \nmake workers use protective equipment, which can often be flawed anyway. Health \nand safety is about making the workplace fit the worker, not vice versa.\nReporting t'boss\n The main advantage of contacting the authorities is that they have the \npower to serve an employer with a Prohibition or Improvement Notice. But \nremember, their bark is often worse than their bite. Cuts mean the HSE rarely \nhave time to carry out inspections. And fines and claims for damages \u2014 \nalthough possible \u2014 are few and far between: It is estimated that at \nleast 70% of workplace injuries are caused by employers' negligence, but only \naround 5% actually get compensation. Still, if you have a good case and plenty \nof persistence, it is worth contacting HSE and/pr the local authority \nEnvironmental Health Department with any uncovered problems which aren't being \ndealt with by management.\nChanging the way we work\n We need to forget the stuffy and bureaucratic image of health and safety. \nThe result of the erosion of working conditions and training means we take more \nrisks and work more dangerously \u2014 the statistics speak for themselves. We \ndon't have anyone else who we can trust to deal with the issue, but ourselves. \nThis may just seen like fine words, but once you start looking critically at \nyour own workplace, and how it could be changed to suit workers, the view of \nthe self-management process snowballs. It becomes clear that if we could \ncontrol our workplaces ourselves, and if we were running them for people's \nneeds, then they would look very different. If we can enforce a safe working \nenvironment we can then go onto question the right of employers to profit from \nour labour in the first place. A small victory over health and safety breeds a \nbit more confidence to go further and change a bit more, and a bit more. The \nlaws may not be made for us, by and large, but, in conjunction with collective \naction, we can use them to our advantage.\n The Solidarity Federation does action in an area that has become the \ndomain of TUC bureaucrats who sit on management safety committees but change \nnothing while thousands of workers are killed. The enforcement of safety \nstandards through direct action in the workplace can turn this horrific \nsituation around. And at the same time, we are on the way to fundamentally \nchanging the way we work forever.\nInformation\n Labour Research Department: 78 Blackfriars Road, London, SE1 8HF.

(Click inside display box on \nleft to start video.) \n\nThe Blood Pressure Discovery That Changed My Life... And That Can Change \nYours Too!\nMy name is David O'Hara. After a near fatal accident 20 years ago a string \nof orthopaedists told me I'd need a double hip replacement or be in a \nwheelchair by the time I was 50.\nThen when I was 50 my doctor diagnosed me with hypertension and told me I \nwould need medication for the rest of my life.\nWell, at 56 now I still enjoy long hikes in the country (with only a slight \nwobble) while my healthy blood pressure boosts my\nconfidence. And the satisfaction of beating all the doctors' predictions \nhelps me sleep through my aches and pains at night!\nNow, I've never been a natural health fanatic but the most important thing \nI want to tell you is thatnatural blood pressure control is possible... and \nI'm going to show you how right here in this website.\nOf course nothing is 100% effective (beware of anyone who tells you \notherwise) but my method is as close to foolproof as you can get (82% \nresponse rate in one of many clinical trials published in respected medical \njournals.\nThat's because it works from a natural physical reaction that's as \nautomatic as the jerk you get when you knock your funny bone.\nI invite you to watch my short (4.5 minutes) video above, and then try my \nonline demo. But if you're not equipped for video that's okay because you'll \nfind everything covered in great detail throughout the website.\nIf you do watch I highly recommend using headphones for best results. Just \nclick anywhere in the video box above and enjoy!\nDoctors Prove That\u00a082% Of Even Resistant Hypertensives* Can Achieve \nLower Blood Pressure By Harnessing The Body's Own Natural Pressure Regulator...\n\n*As published in the American Journal of Hypertension, June 2003 \nImagine a totally natural and clinically-proven way to enjoy:\n\n\nSignificantly lower blood pressure with top reductions averaging 36 \npoints systolic and 20 points diastolic... \n\nLasting and accumulating drops in blood pressure that build up to last \nthroughout the day within 2 to 6 weeks... \n\nDeep relaxation like you haven't felt in ages... \n\nLasting relief of chronic stress and anxiety... \n\nImproved sleep, increasing energy and better moods...  \nAll this and more in just 15 minutes a day... with TOTAL FREEDOM from \ndrugs, herbs, supplements and even difficult or tedious lifestyle makeovers!\nWhat on earth is capable of this?\nDespite what you may have read, you are NOT likely to beat high blood \npressure or get these other benefits with any simple pill, supplement or \n\"superfood\"...\nBlood pressure is a response to complicated metabolic processes, \nparticularly in your blood chemistry. Elevated pressure is telling you that \nyour system is out of balance.\nBut beyond that, the causes of hypertension are numerous and complex, many \nof them still unknown. That's whyhigh blood pressure is one of the most \ndifficult and frustrating conditions you'll ever have to face.\nIt means that even treatment with powerful drugs is far from a sure thing. \nHas your doctor told you that eventhe most effective blood pressure medication -\ndiltiazem - only achieves a 63% response rate?*\nThousands of people are discovering ways to take control\n of their \nblood pressure and other aspects of their health\n without drugs or dodgy \nand expensive \"remedies\".\n* According to a landmark survey for the Veterans' Administration that \nserves as a basic medical reference.\nThe most successful drug treatment usually requires multiple medications. \nSo trying to control something as complex as blood pressure with simple \n\"remedies\" is nearly always a waste of time at best.\u00a0\nNothing worthwhile - like controlling your blood pressure - is ever \ntotally effortless...\nYou're not going to beat hypertension popping a pill or supplement and, \nlikewise, NOTHING is going to significantly impact your blood pressureinstantly \nor with zero effort.\nThe ONLY effective, long-term strategy to beat high blood pressure requires \nthat YOU take an active role in your own health. It's a holistic approach that \nincludes diet, physical activity, stress relief and much more... yes, in other \nwords: it takeslifestyle changes.\nLifestyle again!\nWhat Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Blood Pressure\n\"The most important thing I want to tell you about high blood pressure \nis thatit can almost always be lowered with lifestyle changes...\nBut the conventional medical wisdom is that patients won\u2019t make \nlifestyle changes, and so the automatic response to high blood pressure is to \nprescribe a drug that will reduce it.\nI believe\u2014and there is plenty of research to support me\u2014that \nthese drugs have just as good a chance of killing you as the high blood \npressure does, especially if you don\u2019t really need them.\"\nJohn R. Lee, M.D.\nVirginia Hopkins Health Watch\nThat's right... and I get tired of hearing about it too! But there's no \ndenying the importance of lifestyle to your blood pressure.\nOf course not all high blood pressure is\u00a0 lifestyle-related. But \nexperts claim that up to95% of hypertension cases could be resolved through \nhealthy changes in the way we live.\nEven if you're fit and healthy and think you have a good lifestyle, chances \nare there's something unseen in your life that's causing your hypertension. \nIt's often stress or a combination of issues.\nBut what can we do about it?\nSure, we all want to look and feel good, but a major lifestyle makeover can \nbe a long, hard slog. Sometimes you don't even know where the problem lies. And \njust as the causes of hypertension can be a mystery, the results of lifestyle \nchanges can be unpredictable. They come with no guarantee.\nFor some of us the whole situation can seem next to impossible...\nIsn't there another way???\nYES, while a healthy lifestyle remains your best long-term strategy, a \ngroup of hypertension specialists have come up with a remarkable development. \nTheir breakthrough can not only help you tocontrol your blood pressure naturally\n but it can also help tokickstart that healthier lifestyle.\nThe method is a\u00a0relatively easy \"lifestyle technique\" that \nuses one of the body's most powerful regulators of blood pressure...\nIt's your breathing. And the technique is called \"slow breathing\".\n\nNow when you hear \"slow breathing\" you may automatically think of \ntheexpensive, computerized devices that have been heavily promoted on the \nInternet and in pharmacy chains.\nBut I'm going to show you something completely different - something \nthat could just change your life...\nThat's because you don't need to buy expensive gadgets or take up training \nin yoga or meditation to master slow breathing...\nNow, for the first time, the BreatheEasy System makes slow breathing easy \nand truly practical. In fact, based on more than 5,000 success stories, I \nbelieve that BreatheEasy is actuallymore effective than computerized \nbiofeedback machines because it's simple and enjoyable to use, which encourages \nfrequent use.\nAfter all, nothing - not even fancy gizmos costing hundreds of dollars - \nwill work from the back of a drawer!\nBreatheEasy uses the same clinically-proven breathing techniques developed \nfor biofeedback mixed with beautiful, relaxing music. It comes in a simple and \nuser-friendly audio program\u00a0 available on CD and in a digital mp3 version \n(that you can download instantly tostart dropping your blood pressure today).\n\nGive it a listen yourself: BreatheEasy Sample\nHeadphones recommended for best results. Just click the \n\"Sample\" link above and a little music player will pop out from the \nbottom of the page. It should play automatically but, if not, use the standard \ncontrol buttons on the left. There's also a small volume slider just to the \nright of the main controls. \nThis sample features \"Ambient\" music, just one of many styles \navailable in the BreatheEasy System. You'll get to try many more of them on the\nDemo page.\n10 Good Reasons To Love BreatheEasy\n\n\nFully portable & versatile: use with any CD player, iPod or other mp3 \nplayer. Or use on your computer desktop... \n\nInstant access: Get started now (while awaiting CD delivery) by downloading \na free mp3 version immediately after purchase - lets youstart today! \n\nDigital Only Version also available by download (no CDs delivered) for even \ngreater savings... \n\nUser-friendly: no straps, sensors or other awkward paraphernalia. No USB \ncables or connectors...just good, old-fashioned sound! \n\nSimple: no complicated routines. No tedious counting. No mysterious rituals \nor mumbo-jumbo. No spiritual agendas. Just relax to beautiful music and \nbreathe... \n\nEnjoyable: uses real music... highest quality commercial \nrecordings in a number of music styles to suit everyone... \n\nBuilds independence: typical remedies (including other slow breathing \napplications)create dependence. But the BreatheEasy technique becomes \neffortlessly ingrained in you over time for total independence from external \nresources... \n\nAdaptable: Master the method and use with your own music or simply relaxing \nquietly. Apply slow breathing to a huge range of life circumstances... \neffortlessly acquire a method witha lifetime payoff! \n\nKind to your heart... and to your pocketbook: a mere fraction of the price \nof complicated biofeedback devices and other methods you may have seen \nadvertised -and no recurring costs! \n\nUnconditionally guaranteed with a full 6-month, zero-risk trial! \n\n\"I checked the Resperate on the web and I was not impressed. I did \nsome more research and found Breatheasy... sure glad I did! What a fantastic \nidea... love the music!\"\n(3 weeks later...)\n\"I love the Breatheasy System. My blood pressure is down to 145/87 and \nI'm still on the first CD!\"\nMargaret Hansch\n Toronto, Canada\nAnd did I mention that you can try it right here online... FREE?\nWouldn't you invest just 15 minutes a day, a few times a week, for a \nlifetime payoff?\nOf course, no treatment is 100% effective (and beware of anyone \nclaiming otherwise!). First-hand reports from BreatheEasy users you see on \nthis website are published to show what real people do achieve through slow \nbreathing with music.You may not get the same results.\nBut if you can spare just 15 minutes a day (fifteen relaxing and enjoyable \nminutes) you owe it to yourself to at least find out if slow breathing will \nwork for you as it does for so many others. If you're a skeptic I'd like you to \nknow that the best success stories I hear are oftenfrom those who started \nout the most skeptical.\nWhy would a skeptic try BreatheEasy in the first place?\nFor the same reason I hope you will. I myself was a hard-nosed skeptic once \nso I know what it takes to convince one.\nBy that I mean that I take all the risk by giving you a full 6-month trial \nbacked by a 100% no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee. I'll even pay your \nreturn postage if you're one of the unlucky few who don't get gratifying \nresults.\nSix months! That's unheard of in the health field (they want you \nto be fooled by a short-term placebo effect)...\nSo, as you see, a short but always enjoyable few minutes a day is your \nonly risk to go after something of such incredible benefit.\nLinda Schmid, one of countless slow breathing success stories whose story \nyou can read in this website, wrote me the following:\n\"It is such a shame that so many people can't believe that listening \nto music and breathing to it can lower your blood pressure. I tell my friends \nabout it but they just don't want to try it. I'd like to hit them over the head \nto wake them up but to them only meds can do it... what a waste!\"\nLinda Schmid\n Brainerd, MN \nAll the answers in one easy-to-use location...\nThe tabbed box below offers you a \"bird's eye\" view of the \nwebsite including important features, answers to common questions and comments \nfrom real BreatheEasy users.\nThe main menu at the top of each page offers much greater detail on \neverything related to slow breathing, music and high blood pressure.

My doctor is amazed how well I have reduced my BP without the use \nof drugs. I was borderline high when I started and am now back in the 120/75 \nrange. Not bad for a 60 year old male that does not exercise! This kind of \nhealthcare is priceless.\n\n- Tom Roth\nwww.demo.com \n\nI received my CD package last week.

My \nheart rate and blood pressure did go down but then my energy and mood also took \na nosedive. And my weight went up. I couldn't stand it! I'm so glad I \ndiscovered Breatheasy. My blood pressure and pulse are normal now even though I \nquit the beta-blockers weeks ago. It also helps keep me level-headed but \nwithout taking the edge off like the drugs did.- Katherine Hornton\nSanta \nCruz, CA \n\nI was lucky enough to receive a copy of the Breatheasy System recently, a \nscientifically designed method of coordinating your breathing with music. You \nonly need to spend 15 minutes a day with the system to obtain benefits in your \nblood pressure. I found that it also improved my sleep patterns and helped me \nto relax. It's easy to learn and inexpensive compared to some other methods of \nblood pressure control without medication.- Gordon Cameron, M.D.\n\nwww.bloodpressurehigh.com \n\nI ordered the CDs and have been using them for about 3 months. I am quite \namazed at the wonderful results. I have been trying for years to beat high \nblood pressure with healthy diet and exercise but slow breathing was the \nmissing link! I used to have a BP (with medication) of 130/90 on average \n(sometimes MUCH higher). I've now been able to reduce one of the medications \nprescribed (Atenolol) almost completely and my average BP is about 110/75 with \na pulse around 72!- Hope Harris\nHope Harris Photography\nSacramento, CA \n \nThank you for a wonderful product. My blood pressure went from 145/78 to \n122/65 while using it (along with my medication). I was able to lower my dose \nof Diovan down to 160 mg and it helped motivate me to kickstart a healthy \nlifestyle. Thank you for offering a non-medicating way to tackle blood pressure \nand get back on track to living a normal life.- Torrey Thompson\nKaty, TX \n \nIt's very hard to believe that something so enjoyable to do can lower your \nblood pressure so much, but it does. My blood pressure is in the 120's or the \nlower 130's most all of the time now over 72. As I had mentioned before it had \ngone as high as 190 over 90 but usually averaged around 155 or 160 over 85, so \nI have had a dramatic change thanks to your music.\n\n(See the full range of comments and case studies from real BreatheEasy \nusers in the \"Real-Life Results\" page.\n Documentation of user \nfeedback on file in accordance with FTC regulation.)- Linda Schmid\n\nBrainerd, MN \n  \n\n\nClinically-Proven Slow Breathing\nNot what you get with yoga, meditation or typical guided breathing \nprograms.

Click to open and close \nquestions.\n What is \"slow breathing\" ? \nSlow breathing should not be confused with \"deep \nbreathing\" as often recommended by conventional guided breathing programs \nand some alternative health practices. Slow breathing was clinically developed \nand optimized by hypertension doctorsspecifically to relieve high blood pressure\n and related conditions.Deep breathing, on the other hand, often \nresults in hyperventilation, which canraise blood pressure. Get the \nfull story on slow breathing and what it can achieve under\"The System\"\n in the menu at the top of this page.  What is the BreatheEasy System of \nslow breathing with music ?\nBreatheEasy was the first slow breathing system to do away with expensive \nand complicated biofeedback devices by combining guided slow breathing with \nreal music. The deep relaxation and enjoyment of listening to music makes slow \nbreathing even more effective becausethe more relaxed you are, the greater the \nbenefits. And enjoyment means more frequent use which makes for better \nresults. BreatheEasy is into its 5th year now with many thousands of happy \nusers.  What kind of music does the BreatheEasy System offer ? \nSome of the world's most beautiful and relaxing music in a huge selection \nof tracks to suit all tastes. Classical masterpieces by Bach, Beethoven, Mozart \nand all the \"masters\" performed by top orchestras. BreatheEasy \nAmbient features dreamy and meditative modern relaxation music, from the best\nhuman composers (not computer-generated!).\nThere's also a CD of superb nature tracks plus one of exotic \n\"world\" music like Indian classical (raga) and traditional Tibetan \ninstruments. Try our demo and sample some yourself. Once you master the slow \nbreathing methodyou can even use it with your own music. See full \nspecifications on theProduct Tour page.  Is there any proof that slow \nbreathing and/or music can lower blood pressure ?\nSlow breathing can boast levels of proof above any natural blood pressure \nremedy,equaled only by pharmaceuticals. In fact, slow breathing has undergone \nthe same rigorous testing as drugs with results documented in respected \nmedical journals around the world. Music trials have produced equally \nimpressive findings recently. See the trials and even more proof for yourself \nin theClinical Results page.  How long does it take ? \nOne of so many great things about this method is that you get maximum \nresults in just 15 minutes a day. You don't have to do it every day but 3-4 \ntimes a week is the minimum and 5 times a week is ideal. As for results this \ncan vary quite a bit: some people see reductions in their blood pressure from \nthe very first time while for others it takes a couple weeks or so. Nearly \neveryone should get results within 4 to 6 weeks.  What other benefits can I \nget from slow breathing ?\nOur breathing is connected with other parts of the body like the \ncirculatory and nervous systems andaffects virtually every aspect of our \nhealth and wellbeing. Specifically, slow breathing (and music) can relieve \nchronic stress in a way that simple relaxation will never do. It is also very \neffective atcontrolling anxiety and panic disorders.\nBut that's just a start: slow breathing can improve sleeping, increase \nenergy and help the body to detoxify (the respiratory system accounts for \nup to 70% of the body's toxic waste disposal). And at the end of the day, slow \nbreathing with music offers deep relaxation like you haven't felt in ages!  \nWhat is the BreatheEasy Zero-Risk Trial ?\nUse BreatheEasy for a full SIX MONTHS. If you are not totally happy with \nyour results simply return the product (or delete the files in case of \ndownload-only purchase) for animmediate 100% refund, no questions asked.\n AND I'll not only refund your original shipping charges...

Why should \nI order now ?\nThe sooner you take action against high blood pressure the easier it will \nbe and the less damage it can do.

He is on amlodipine and moduretic. He loves his morning coffee \n(Nestle) and tea.\nA:  As a coffee lover, I roast my own beans, this is a \ntough question. It really depends on how much caffeine you are consuming. Two \ncups a day, 200-300 mg of caffeine, is okay. If you get a headache when you \ndon\u2019t have your morning coffee, you are drinking too much. To figure out \nthe amount of caffeine you are drinking,click here.

My blood \npressure is about 130/95 without meds. Is that okay?\nA: I am more worried about your drinking habits than your \npre-hypertension. Your blood pressure is in the range where you should start \nmaking lifestyle changes to get it into better control. You are drinking over \nan average sized bottle of wine a night. This is not healthy. I suggest you \ndiscuss this with your doctor.

My blood pressure has been good since I started taking it, but I have \nnoticed that I get constipated with this medication and I was wondering if \nthere is another kind of medication in the same group of meds that would not \nhave that side effect.\nA:  Amlodipine is a type of drug known as a calcium \nchannel blocker. Constipation is a frequent complaint with this type of \nmedication. Since you are doing well on Amlodipine, you might want to try \nincreasing the fiber in your diet. A couple of prunes a day can make a \ndifference.

Depending on how high the blood pressure, drugs may also be needed. \nNeither a regular exercise program nor medication is a cure for high blood \npressure. Once you stop either one, high blood pressure will return.

What can I do to prevent \nthis?\nA:  It is important that you stay on your medicine for \ndiabetes. There are only two ways to prevent the weight gain. You can either \neat less or exercise more. A combination of less eating and more exercising is \ndoubly effective. The calories you consume must be less than the calories you \nburn with daily activities for weight loss to occur.

What is the best way to help it \nwithout medication? Also, every time I go to the gynecologist, my blood \npressure is sky high even though I take Inderal 60 mg on a daily basis. What \nhelps white coat syndrome?\nA: Exercise. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce \nanxiety and is good for your heart. Most of us don\u2019t make time in our \nlives for enough exercise. Shorts bursts of exercise scattered throughout the \nday are effective. Thinking it takes an hour long session to get results is \nwrong. Do what you can when you have some time. Ten minutes here and there can \nreally make a difference. Learning to control your anxiety especially that is \nassociated with a doctor visit can help with white coat syndrome.

I have been following a rigid diet \nand exercise program and it does not seem to help.\nA: Eating right and having a regular exercise program have \nbeen shown to help lower blood pressure. However switching to a healthy \nlifestyle, after years of abuse, may not be enough to get your pressure back \ndown to normal. Even if you can\u2019t get your pressure back to normal, keep \nexercising. Regular exercise has many health benefits. For current \nrecommendations on physical activity and its benefitsclick here.

I have taken fosamax for many years and see no results of improvement in \nbone density test. My doctor insists I take the drug. Is there anything else I \ncan use?\nA:  Regular weight bearing exercise helps prevent bone \nloss. The old saying, if you don\u2019t use it, you lose it, is very true with \nbone loss. Taking calcium supplements along with coffee or other caffeine \ncontaining beverage may block some absorption but that doesn\u2019t keep me \nfrom enjoying a latte or cappuccino.

However, antihistamine products that also \ncontain a decongestant can elevate blood pressure. It is important to read \npackage labels and understand if you are getting just an antihistamine or a \ncombination product.

Is it possible that my kidneys and/or the eye drops contribute to my \nhigh BP?\nA: It is possible that both your kidney problems and your \nglaucoma are contributing to your high blood pressure. A doctor has to balance \nthe benefits of treating a disease against the possibility of worsening another \ncondition you might have. Untreated glaucoma can lead to blindness.

Regular exercise has been shown to relieve \nstress and help both of these conditions. Medications that are used to treat \nirritable bowel syndrome and allergies can elevate blood pressure.

Is it a given that type 2 will lead to \ntype 1? Can type 1 be reversed with diet, weight loss, and exercise?\nA: Some people with late onset or Type 2 diabetes will \neventually require insulin to control their disease. This does not happen to \neveryone, especially not those who lose weight, start exercising and watch what \nthey eat. Usually people who need insulin to start with, Type 1 or insulin \ndependent diabetics, will not be able to control their diabetes with diet, \nweight loss and exercise.

It therefore followed that relaxation \nand stress relief would have only a negligible and/or temporary effect on blood \npressure.\nBut fresh research is now beginning to reveal the obvious: high stress \nlevels are linked to high blood pressure. As part of the natural human reaction \nfor fight or flight under pressure, stress causes hormone levels in the body to \nrise. These changes, if they occur chronically, can easily become a major \nfactor or even the primary cause of high blood pressure.\nEven in cases of secondary hypertension, whereby high blood pressure is \ncaused by some organic cause, stress can be a major aggravator of the condition.\n\nSo if high levels of stress are a major factor in high blood pressure, it \nstands to reason that reducing stress canlower blood pressure. This approach is \nquick, effective, and does not require medication or costly doctor's visits.\nMany high blood pressure sufferers are looking for easy ways to manage \ntheir blood pressure at home, without drugs. The first step in lowering your \nblood pressure should always begin with a few simple lifestyle changes, \nincluding learning stress management techniques. These techniques, together \nwith your doctor\u2019s advice, can help lower your blood pressure quickly and \neasily.\nA few easy ways to reduce stress:\n\n\nGet more sleep. The human body needs at least eight hours \nof sleep per night. This gives both the mind and body a chance to rest, \nrecuperate and recharge. Without this opportunity, you will quickly become \ntired, cranky, and stressed. Lack of sleep can lead to elevated stress levels \nand elevated blood pressure. \n\nExercise regularly\u00a0Regular exercise will help lower \nyour blood pressure, while adding energy and vitality to your daily life. \nExercise is also a great stress reliever, allowing you to work off tension \nwhile you move your body. Losing weight may be an added benefit of exercising \nfrequently and this can further reduce blood pressure. \n\nEat a balanced diet.\u00a0 Eating nutritious and whole \nfoods will not only help lower your blood pressure, but your stress levels as \nwell. A diet rich in vitamins and nutrients, with plenty of whole grains, lean \nmeats, fruits and vegetables, is crucial to good health.  \nProcessed foods, for example, often contain unnatural amounts of salt, \nwhich upsets the normal balance of sodium, magnesium and potassium in the body, \nraising blood pressure. You can counteract this by eating whole foods with a \nnatural balance of minerals and/or by taking a modest magnesium supplement. The \nextra benefit is that magnesium and calcium also help calm the nerves and \nreduce stress.\n\n\nTake time for yourself every day.\u00a0 Making sure you \nget down time is a great way to lower your stress levels. Don\u2019t bring \nwork home with you. Take time to relax, spend time with your family, play a \ngame, read a book, or just unwind. This time is essential to your well-being.\n \n\nExpress your feelings. It is important to have a partner \nor close friend to vent to. Keeping your feelings bottled up inside is \ndangerous and unhealthy. Sharing your problems with someone is a great and \npositive way to reduce stress and lower blood pressure as well. \n\nSlow breathing. You will often hear this described as \n\"deep breathing\" but slow breathing is a much more helpful way to \nthink of it. Slow breathing and relaxation can be an easy way to lower your \nstress. Taking just a few minutes every day to relax and unwind to some gentle \nmusic while breathing slowly and deeply may be just the ticket to dropping \nthose numbers at your next doctor\u2019s visit.  \nBy making a few simple lifestyle changes like these, you too can lower your \nstress levels and lower your blood pressure. Start a stress management program \ntoday! You\u2019ll be glad you made these changes, and your blood pressure \nwill show it too.\nDiscover more about  slow breathing with music for lower blood pressure.\n\nHome | Demo | Clinical Results | Real-Life Results | Articles | FAQ | About \n|Customer Service | Purchase \n\n\u00a9 2006-2009 Control-Your-Blood-Pressure.com \u00b7 Breatheasy\u2122 \nis a trademark of The Low Pressure Zone.\n\u00a9 2009 The Low Pressure Zone.

Exercise also helps reduce your risk ofheart disease\n. You only need 30 minutes of moderate-level exercise on most days of the week \nto become physically active. Examples of such activities include:\n \u00a0 \n\nBrisk walking \nRaking leaves \nGardening \nBicycling.  \u00a0    If it's more convenient, you can even \ndivide the 30 minutes into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each.  \u00a0 \n If you already engage in 30 minutes of moderate-level exercise a day, you can \nget added benefits by doing more. Engage in moderate-level exercise for a \nlonger period each day or engage in a more vigorous activity.  \u00a0  Most \npeople don't need to see a doctor before they start a moderate-level exercise \nprogram. However, you should check first with your doctor if you:  \u00a0 \n\nHave a family history of heart disease at an early age \nHave heart trouble or have had a heart attack \nAre over age 50 and are not used to moderate-level physical activity \nHave any other serious health problem.  \u00a0   High Blood \nPressure and Exercise Article Continues on Next Page > \n\n\n\n Advertisement \n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nWritten \nby/reviewed by: Arthur Schoenstadt, MD \nLast reviewed by: Arthur \nSchoenstadt, MD \n\nAdvertisement \n \u00a0  Other Articles in This \neMedTV Presentation\n\u00a0 \u00a0How to Lower Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0High Blood Pressure Medication\n\u00a0 \u00a0High Blood Pressure Diet\n\u00a0 \u00a0DASH Diet for Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Weight and High Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Salt and High Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Alcohol and Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Supplements for High Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Does Smoking Cause High Blood Pressure?\n\u00a0 \u00a0Stress and High Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0High Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0What Causes High Blood Pressure?\n\u00a0 \u00a0Physical Symptoms of High Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Measuring Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0How to Lower Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0High Blood Pressure Medication\n\u00a0 \u00a0Effects of High Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0High Blood Pressure and Health\n\u00a0 \u00a0High Blood Pressure Prevention\n\u00a0 \u00a0Foods That Lower Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Alcohol and Blood Pressure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Does Smoking Cause High Blood Pressure? \n\n\n\n Referring Pages Articles \n\nTerms of Use Advertise with Us Contact \nUs About eMedTV Privacy Policy \n\n Copyright \u00a9 2006-2012 Clinaero, Inc.\n\n eMedTV serves only as \nan informational resource.

Data from various sources. This chart and the \nfollowing text were prepared in 2003. Any updates would be welcome. \nFirst, it should be stated that the single most significant threat to bird \npopulations is habitat destruction, in all of its forms and with all of its \ncauses. The various causes of mortality outlined below kill individual birds \ndirectly, and can certainly have an adverse effect on population size, but can \nactually have a beneficial effect in some cases. Studies of hunting have \ndocumented that in certain cases killing small numbers of birds can\u00a0\nimprove the health and survival of the remaining birds. As long as the \nhabitat is intact, the population has the potential to replace the lost birds.\n\nIn simplest terms, habitat destruction reduces the population by reducing \nthe available resources, denying birds the chance to reproduce, and effectively \nputting a cap on the population size.\n The problems outlined below are \nserious threats and are implicated in the declines of many species. They should \nbe addressed.\nCollisions\nWindow strikes \u2013 estimated to kill 97\u00a0to 976 \nmillion birds/year \u2013 Millions of houses and buildings, with their \nbillions of windows,\u00a0pose a significant threat to birds. Birds see the \nnatural habitat mirrored in the glass and fly directly into the window, causing \ninjury and, in 50% or more of the cases, death. Simple steps can be taken to \nreduce the number of birds striking windows. Decals that stick to the glass are \nnot very effective, but strips of tape on the outside of the glass, or strings \nor feathers hanging outside the window, each no more than 10 inches apart, are \nfairly effective. Decorative features like stained glass designs or window \ndividers can achieve the same result. Outside screens are very effective both \nto reduce the reflection and to cushion the impact. In short, anything that \nreduces or breaks up the window\u2019s reflection will reduce bird strikes. \nLots of excellent info at\u00a0FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program) ; follow \nthe link to collision prevention and be sure to check out the \n\u201cCollidEscape\u201d film.\nCommunication towers \u2013 estimates of bird kills are \nimpossible to make because of the lack of data, but totals could easily be over \n5 million birds/year, and possibly as many as 50 million. Towers have \nproliferated in recent\u00a0years,\u00a0with an estimated 5000 new towers \nerected per year during the 1990s, mainly for the cell phone and digital TV \nindustries. Any tall structure will kill birds by collision, and lighted towers \nattract birds at night. Theoretically\u00a0cellphone\u00a0towers are less \ndangerous than the taller structures, but there is no data either way, and the \nsheer number of cell phone towers may outweigh any other advantage. More info \nat\u00a0FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program) and\u00a0TOWERKILL .\nHigh tension line collisions \u2013 may kill up to 174 \nmillion birds per year. This figure extrapolates from European studies to the \nmillions of miles of aerial wires in\u00a0North America. There are very few \ndata in\u00a0North America.\nElectrocutions kill tens of thousands of birds per year. \nThis occurs mainly when large birds such as raptors make contact between a live \nelectrical wire and a ground such as a pole. The relatively small number of \nbirds affected belies the significance of this threat, since species such as \nGolden Eagle are more susceptible. Large predators like eagles have smaller \npopulation sizes and lower reproduction rates than songbirds, so removing a few \nthousand birds from the population will have a much larger impact than removing \nthe same number of, say, Savannah Sparrows. Studies by\nHawkWatch\u00a0International revealed an electrocution rate of just under 1 \nbird per 100 poles per year, or 547 birds at 74,000 poles in\u00a0Utah\u00a0in \n2001-2002. About 10% of the birds killed were Golden Eagles, 34% Ravens, and \nanother 25%Buteos\u00a0(Red-tailed, Swainson\u2019s and Ferruginous Hawks). \nFortunately PacifiCorp, the owner of the poles, is committed to making changes \nto reduce electrocutions, and hopefully other regions will follow.\nCars may kill 60 million birds per year.\u00a0\u00a0Of \nover 8 million lane miles of roads in the\u00a0US, 6.3 million, or over \n\u00be, are in rural areas where most birds are presumably killed. \nThere\u2019s not much we can do about this source of bird mortality short of \nchanging our driving habits, but landscaping the roadside to discourage birds \nfrom congregating there is helpful. My own sense is that small cars with more \naerodynamic designs hit fewer birds, while large boxy vans and trucks hit more \nbirds, but I don\u2019t think this has been studied. By the way, 100 years ago \nthere were fewer than 250 miles of paved roads in\u00a0North America, all in \nurban centers.\nWind turbines may kill 33,000 birds per year, and, as in \nthe case of electrocutions, these birds tend to be large and scarce (e.g. \nraptors). The recent surge of interest in wind power has heightened concerns \nabout their effect on birds, and has led to at least the discussion of efforts \nby the wind power industry to design more benign windmills and to choose \nlocations that are less \u201cbirdy\u201d. It\u2019s difficult for an \nenvironmentalist to come out against renewable energy like wind turbines, but \nas long as the electricity generated is considered a \u201csupplement\u201d \nto satisfy increasing demand, wind power will not really help the fight against \nglobal warming. Establishment of wind farms should go hand-in-hand with drastic \ncuts in electricity use, and there is a real need for more study of the \nrelationship between birds and wind farms.\nPoisoning\nPesticides may kill 72 million birds per year or possibly \nmany more.

This is \napproximately 1/100 the minimum estimate for bird deaths from windows, and an \nestimated 10-fold decrease in bird fatalities relative to a coal-fired grid \n(based on the same paper).\nI have tried to understand the fierce opposition to wind farms by some \nenvironmental groups. I suspect it is because they make easy targets. After \nall, they\u2019re suppose to be good for the environment, right?. When viewed \nin comparison to alternatives, they seem to be more environmentally friendly, \nand thus should probably not be opposed with such zeal.

Data from various sources. This chart and the \nfollowing text were prepared in 2003. Any updates would be welcome. \nFirst, it should be stated that the single most significant threat to bird \npopulations is habitat destruction, in all of its forms and with all of its \ncauses. The various causes of mortality outlined below kill individual birds \ndirectly, and can certainly have an adverse effect on population size, but can \nactually have a beneficial effect in some cases. Studies of hunting have \ndocumented that in certain cases killing small numbers of birds can\u00a0\nimprove the health and survival of the remaining birds. As long as the \nhabitat is intact, the population has the potential to replace the lost birds.\n\nIn simplest terms, habitat destruction reduces the population by reducing \nthe available resources, denying birds the chance to reproduce, and effectively \nputting a cap on the population size.\n The problems outlined below are \nserious threats and are implicated in the declines of many species. They should \nbe addressed.\nCollisions\nWindow strikes \u2013 estimated to kill 97\u00a0to 976 \nmillion birds/year \u2013 Millions of houses and buildings, with their \nbillions of windows,\u00a0pose a significant threat to birds. Birds see the \nnatural habitat mirrored in the glass and fly directly into the window, causing \ninjury and, in 50% or more of the cases, death. Simple steps can be taken to \nreduce the number of birds striking windows. Decals that stick to the glass are \nnot very effective, but strips of tape on the outside of the glass, or strings \nor feathers hanging outside the window, each no more than 10 inches apart, are \nfairly effective. Decorative features like stained glass designs or window \ndividers can achieve the same result. Outside screens are very effective both \nto reduce the reflection and to cushion the impact. In short, anything that \nreduces or breaks up the window\u2019s reflection will reduce bird strikes. \nLots of excellent info at\u00a0FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program) ; follow \nthe link to collision prevention and be sure to check out the \n\u201cCollidEscape\u201d film.\nCommunication towers \u2013 estimates of bird kills are \nimpossible to make because of the lack of data, but totals could easily be over \n5 million birds/year, and possibly as many as 50 million. Towers have \nproliferated in recent\u00a0years,\u00a0with an estimated 5000 new towers \nerected per year during the 1990s, mainly for the cell phone and digital TV \nindustries. Any tall structure will kill birds by collision, and lighted towers \nattract birds at night. Theoretically\u00a0cellphone\u00a0towers are less \ndangerous than the taller structures, but there is no data either way, and the \nsheer number of cell phone towers may outweigh any other advantage. More info \nat\u00a0FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program) and\u00a0TOWERKILL .\nHigh tension line collisions \u2013 may kill up to 174 \nmillion birds per year. This figure extrapolates from European studies to the \nmillions of miles of aerial wires in\u00a0North America. There are very few \ndata in\u00a0North America.\nElectrocutions kill tens of thousands of birds per year. \nThis occurs mainly when large birds such as raptors make contact between a live \nelectrical wire and a ground such as a pole. The relatively small number of \nbirds affected belies the significance of this threat, since species such as \nGolden Eagle are more susceptible. Large predators like eagles have smaller \npopulation sizes and lower reproduction rates than songbirds, so removing a few \nthousand birds from the population will have a much larger impact than removing \nthe same number of, say, Savannah Sparrows. Studies by\nHawkWatch\u00a0International revealed an electrocution rate of just under 1 \nbird per 100 poles per year, or 547 birds at 74,000 poles in\u00a0Utah\u00a0in \n2001-2002. About 10% of the birds killed were Golden Eagles, 34% Ravens, and \nanother 25%Buteos\u00a0(Red-tailed, Swainson\u2019s and Ferruginous Hawks). \nFortunately PacifiCorp, the owner of the poles, is committed to making changes \nto reduce electrocutions, and hopefully other regions will follow.\nCars may kill 60 million birds per year.\u00a0\u00a0Of \nover 8 million lane miles of roads in the\u00a0US, 6.3 million, or over \n\u00be, are in rural areas where most birds are presumably killed. \nThere\u2019s not much we can do about this source of bird mortality short of \nchanging our driving habits, but landscaping the roadside to discourage birds \nfrom congregating there is helpful. My own sense is that small cars with more \naerodynamic designs hit fewer birds, while large boxy vans and trucks hit more \nbirds, but I don\u2019t think this has been studied. By the way, 100 years ago \nthere were fewer than 250 miles of paved roads in\u00a0North America, all in \nurban centers.\nWind turbines may kill 33,000 birds per year, and, as in \nthe case of electrocutions, these birds tend to be large and scarce (e.g. \nraptors). The recent surge of interest in wind power has heightened concerns \nabout their effect on birds, and has led to at least the discussion of efforts \nby the wind power industry to design more benign windmills and to choose \nlocations that are less \u201cbirdy\u201d. It\u2019s difficult for an \nenvironmentalist to come out against renewable energy like wind turbines, but \nas long as the electricity generated is considered a \u201csupplement\u201d \nto satisfy increasing demand, wind power will not really help the fight against \nglobal warming. Establishment of wind farms should go hand-in-hand with drastic \ncuts in electricity use, and there is a real need for more study of the \nrelationship between birds and wind farms.\nPoisoning\nPesticides may kill 72 million birds per year or possibly \nmany more. The sub lethal effects of pesticides may also make the birds more \nsusceptible to predators or unable to reproduce, essentially killing them. \nA\u00a0New York study in 2000 found that common \u201cover-the-counter\u201d \npesticides were responsible for more bird deaths there than West Nile Virus. \nMore info about pesticides and birds can be found at\u00a0The American Bird \nConservancy, and\u00a0BIRDSOURCE \natCornell\u00a0University.\u00a0The\u00a0Canadian Wildlife Service maintains a \nwebsite with information about pesticides at\u00a0\nhttp://www.cws-scf.ec.gc.ca/nwrc-cnrf/toxic/what_e.cfm\nOil spills kill hundreds of thousands of birds a year or \nmore.

Huh?\nThanks for this overview, David!\n\n Carole \n March 26, 2011 at 11:12 PM  \u00b7 Reply \nIf one believes in a creator who created the various species, then one \nwould necessary have to believe that the creator intended predators to kill. \nIndeed, many species have to kill to live. I don\u2019t think a cat could \nsurvive on a vegetarian diet. So either the cat kills or is fed animals that \nothers have killed and made into cat food.   \n Linda \n October 28, 2010 at 1:45 AM  \u00b7 Reply \nThe \u2018impacts\u2019 paper on the below web page estimates mortality \nof birds due to cat predation to be one billion.\nhttp://www.abcbirds.org/abcprograms/policy/cats/tnr.html\nCollision mortality updates:\n\nhttp://www.abcbirds.org/abcprograms/policy/collisions/index.html\nA variety of other threats are covered.

Clearly emotional responses often indicate \nan opinion formed on the basis of events not related to the issue at hand.\nNo energy source has no impact on the environment. The challenge is to try \nto use energy sources that represent the best long-term compromises with the \nleast impact and are sustainable. If birds are the only issue of importance \n(and in my opinion, this is one of several important issues regarding energy) \nthen you ought to compare how many birds are killed or habitat destroyed by \nacid rain or the construction of other types of power plants. Those are just \ntwo examples.\nStay scientific. Let facts lead you. We need learned and calm consideration \nof our alternatives or we will never solve our problems. Your post gives me \nhope for our future.\nGood luck with your investigation!   \n Getachew \n October 1, 2011 at 9:23 AM  \u00b7 Reply \nI am afried by what wind power is doing on birds. \n heidi \n December 2, 2011 at 10:47 AM  \u00b7 Reply \nRe: wind turbines and raptors, I\u2019m not sure exactly why that \nassumption is being perpetuated \u2013 Altamont Pass was hell on raptors, but \nnew turbine designs don\u2019t lure raptors in for perching\u2026 Instead \nthey kill everything from warblers to ducks and beyond. I\u2019m sure Altamont \ndid the same, but raptors were the primary concern there. Raptors aren\u2019t \nthe whole story for new turbine designs. Bats have it far worse than birds and \nthat needs to be addressed far more seriously than it has been historically.\nI\u2019d like to see more of the \u2018bladeless\u2019 and vertical axis \ndesigns explored; 3 blade designs are hell on wildlife. \n dv \n December 30, 2011 at 8:32 PM  \u00b7 Reply \nBased on slovacool, \u201cContextualizing avian mortality: a preliminary \nappraisal of bird and bat fatalities from wind, fossil-fuel, and nuclear \nelectricity\u201d, which finds an average avian mortality of 0.3/GWh, if the \nentire US electrical base (3700 TWh/yr) were replaced with wind turbines, \napproximately 1.2 million birds would die each year from wind power. This is \napproximately 1/100 the minimum estimate for bird deaths from windows, and an \nestimated 10-fold decrease in bird fatalities relative to a coal-fired grid \n(based on the same paper).\nI have tried to understand the fierce opposition to wind farms by some \nenvironmental groups. I suspect it is because they make easy targets. After \nall, they\u2019re suppose to be good for the environment, right?. When viewed \nin comparison to alternatives, they seem to be more environmentally friendly, \nand thus should probably not be opposed with such zeal. When looking to \nminimize bird deaths, it also seems that even minor efforts to reduce kills by \nferal cats, windows, and cars would completely dwarf any change in kill rate \npossible with turbines, even with vertical axis designs. \n Barry \n January 6, 2012 at 9:08 AM  \u00b7 Reply \nI see these estimate from the wind lobby are still around. In NJ they \nerected 5 large wind turbines near Atlantic City on an island in an estuary. \nThere local Audubon Study concludes that 74 birds and bat were killed per \nturbine per year. 4 Osprey(pop 800) and 1 peregrine Falcon(pop 30) were \nconfirmed killed and they estimate there recovery rate is only 37% so more were \nlikely killed. There are thousand planned so the NE should plan for the \nextinction of many raptors\u2026 here is the the study\n\nhttp://www.ceoe.udel.edu/lewesturbine/documents/acua_quarterlyreport_fall09.pdf\n\nCurrently in California more Golden Eagles are killed by wind turbines than \nreproduced. The large more modern wind turbines actually are more in the flight \npath of large raptors and kill more. The SF Audubon has shown an increase in \nkills the better searches and larger turbines. \n Barry \n January 6, 2012 at 9:13 AM  \u00b7 Reply \nHow many Eagles are killed by windows? Feral cat killing Golden Eagles? I \nthink the above estimate are a fraud places by wind turbine enthusiast. The \nEAgle protection act and the bird migration treaty both should be enforced \nagainst wind turbine companies, just like against oil companies. But the flow \nof subsidies to wind are just too great\u2026the Gov of Maine went into the \nwind industry after setting up the laws to enrich himself. \n Barry \n January 6, 2012 at 12:10 PM  \u00b7 Reply \nOne last comment about the estimated BILLION birds hitting \nbuilding\u2026I have seen estimated that say we have 8-10 Billion birds in \nthe USA\u2026do you really believe that 10-15 percent of the bird population \nis wiped out every year?  \nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\u00a0\u00a0Name (required)\n\u00a0\u00a0Email (will not be published) (required)\n\u00a0\u00a0Website\n\nYou can use these HTML tags\n<a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr \ntitle=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> \n<blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del \ndatetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> \n<strike> <strong>\n \n \nSearch this website \n\nCommission a painting of your favorite bird \nOriginal art for sale \nThe Sibley eGuide to Birds \nPosters, books, t-shirts, etc. \nIdentifiable Subspecies \nSubscribe\n\nLog in\nEntries RSS\nComments RSS\nWordPress.org  \n Copyright \u00a9 2012 Sibley Guides - All Rights Reserved\nPowered by \nWordPress & Atahualpa  \n\n\n\n"}

This project will be the first \ncommercial application of a technology that can generate electrical power ocean \ncurrents. It is a concept that has been debated, researched and debated over \nseveral years. Unlike tidal power stations that can only generate power for up \nto 10-hours per day, installations like the proposed Bermuda project could \ngenerate power throughout the day.\n The installation at Bermuda may be the \"proof of concept\" and \nthe basis upon which larger and more powerful versions of this technology may \nbe developed. There are numerous other locations around the world where \nprevailing ocean conditions would favour larger installations that have higher \ngeneration capacity. While the construction and installation cost of the \ntechnology may be high, its operating cost over long-term is expected to be \ncomparable to that of shore-based hydroelectric installations. Several \nfavourable locations where undersea windmills may be installed actually lie \noutside of heavily traveled commercial shipping lanes. Some of the locations \nwould include:\n Strait of Florida: \n The Gulf Stream flows from the Gulf of Mexico and a portion of it flows \ninto the 12-mile wide channel entrance to the channel that lies between Key \nLargo and the southeast tip of Florida. This channel gently converges over \n15-miles to a width of 2-miles and water depth is less than 150-ft. The current \nat this point in the channel may be strong enough to enable undersea windmills \nto generate an estimated 10-megawatts of electric power that may mainly be used \nin the Florida Keys.\n Bahamas:\n A portion of the Gulf Stream flows from Florida Strait into the Northwest \nProvidence Channel of the Bahamas and through the 30-mile wide entrance to \nLittle Bahama Bank that lies between Grand Bahama and Great Abaco Islands. The \nGulf Stream and Equatorial Current merge in this region and flow into the \nAtlantic through a 2-mile wide exit between Little Abaco and Great Abaco \nIslands and also through an 8-mile wide exit that lies between Little Abaco and \nGrand Bahama Islands. Undersea windmills capable of generating over \n100-megawatts of electric power may be installed at these exists that are less \nthan 150-ft in depth.\n Trinidad and Tobago:\n A portion of the South Equatorial Current diverges to the northwest along \nthe Brazilian coast toward the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. These islands \nform an angle that captures a band of ocean current that is 80-miles wide and \nwithin a distance of 20-miles, the band of current converges into the 20-mile \nwide channel that lies between the 2-islands. This causes a strong ocean \ncurrent to flow through the channel where the water depth is less than 150-ft \nnear Trinidad and less than 600-ft near Tobago. At the present time electricity \non these islands is generated using natural gas and diesel. In the long-term \nfuture, a \"farm\" of large undersea windmills that could be installed \nin the channel near Tobago and generate up to 1000-megawatts of power.\n Indonesia:\n As the Equatorial Counter Current moves eastward across the Indian Ocean, \nthe 45-degree angle of the Sumatra coastline will deflect a wide band of ocean \ncurrent toward the 45-mile wide entrance to Sunda Strait that lies between \nSumatra and Java. The strait is 80-miles long and converges to a width of \n10-miles near its exist. The water depth rises from over 6000-ft in the Indian \nOcean (200-miles to the east) to under 150-ft at the narrowest point in the \nstrait. The converging strait would assure that a fast current would flow \nthrough undersea windmills located at the narrowest point. These units may need \nto be built to a restricted height so as to allow ships with deep keels to pass \noverhead. Alternatively, special shipping lanes may be implemented in Sunda \nStrait so as allow the maximum height of windmills to operate there.\n Indonesia may have a potential of over 2000-megawatts of tidal electric \npower, much of which could be sold to Singapore where power stations consume \nexpensive natural gas to produce power. A portion of the Indonesian tidal power \nmay be used to generate hydrogen that would be sold to markets in Japan, China, \nHong Kong and possibly Singapore. If the Government of Indonesia is willing, \nprivate investors could finance the installation of ocean power conversion \nsystems around Indonesia.\n New Zealand:\n There are two sites around New Zealand's South Island where undersea \nwindmills may be installed. The angle formed by South Island and Stewart Island \ncaptures a 70-mile wide band of the West Wind Drift Ocean Current and forces it \nto converge into the 20-mile wide Foveaux Strait. The water depth changes \nrapidly from under 600-ft outside the strait to under 150-feet in the strait. \nThe combined convergence of width and depth causes a strong current to flow in \nthe strait where a \"farm\" of undersea windmills may be installed and \ngenerate up to 1000-megawatts of power.\n A portion of the West Wind Drift merges with the East Australian Current \nand is deflected to flow in a northeasterly direction along the 500-mile west \ncoast of New Zealand's South Island and into the 60-mile wide (north - south \ndistance) entrance to Cook Strait. Twice a day an eastward-moving band of tidal \nrise from the Tasman Sea that is 450-miles wide would combine with this ocean \ncurrent. The converging angle made by New Zealand's two main islands would \nfunnel the tidal rise into the entrance of Cook Strait that further converges \nto a width of 12-miles at its narrowest point.\n For power to be generated in Cook Strait, undersea windmills may need to \nbe installed between Cape Jackson and Kapiti Island where the water depth is \nless than 600-feet. This channel may be made narrower by building breakwaters \nand shallower by depositing rocks and boulders on the channel floor. The \nreduced width and depth of the flow of water would increase the speed of the \ncurrent that would flow through the artificially narrowed channel where up to \n2000-megawatts of electric power could be generated. A designated shipping \nchannel may have to be implemented in Cook Strait at a future time if power \nfrom the ocean is to be generated there. This power generation would be \ncomplimented by New Zealand's high capacity for hydraulic energy storage.\n Australia:\n The West Wind Drift Ocean Current moves eastward along the southern coast \nof Australia and into Bass Strait. The angle that of southwest coast of the \nState of Victoria deflects a 165-mile band of this ocean current into the \n40-mile wide channel between Cape Otway and King Island. The sea floor also \nrises over 120-miles from a depth of over 6000-ft outside the channel to under \n600-ft in the channel. This combined convergence of width and height would \nassure that a strong tidal current would flow in this channel where in the \ndistant future, a \"farm\" of undersea windmills may be installed \nbetween King Island and Cape Otway and generate some 3,000-megawatts of power \nfrom the ocean current.\n Other Sites:\n There a numerous other suitable straits and channels around the world \nwhere the combination of ocean currents, ocean tides, changes in ocean depth \nand converging coastlines (wide entrance and narrow exit) allow undersea \nwindmills to be installed to generate power. The list of such sites would \ninclude:\n\nTsugaru-kaikyo channel between Hokkaido and Honshu in Japan; \nMuskeget Channel between Martha's Vinyard and Nantucket Island, USA; \nThe deeper channel in Strait of Dover (below depth of ships\u2019 keels); \n\nThe entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar (below depth of ships' keels); \n\nDardenelles, Turkey (below depth of ships' keels); \nStrait of Bab el Mandeb (below depth of ships\u2019 keels); \nThe channel between St Vincent Gulf and Encounter Bay, Australia; \n The channel between Fraser Island and Eastern Australia; \nThe channel between New Britain and Papua New Guinea \n Technology:\n Submersible windmills are being installed in rivers such as the Hudson \nRiver near New York City. Bi-directional undersea windmills are being tested \nfor future use at ocean inlets where power would be generated from the \ntwice-daily change in ocean tides. As the technology develops in the future, \nlarger undersea windmills with much greater generation capacity will appear. \nPower generation from undersea windmills will be more consistent than power \ngeneration from land-based windmills. The ocean tides and currents are more \nreliable than prevailing winds and ocean water has 870-times the density of \nair. Undersea power generation technology is likely to become more viable in \nthe long-term future and may do so in the absence of special tax breaks and \nsubsidies from governments. The pioneering installation in Bermuda may be the \nforerunner of a technology that will serve the economic needs of many nations \nin the long-term future. \n For information on purchasing reprints of \nthis article, contactsales. \n Copyright 2012 CyberTech, Inc. \n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0 \n\nContact The Author \nEmail the author \n \n\n\n\u00a0 \nClick Here For More Articles on Future & Alternative Generation\n \n\nClick Here For More Articles By Harry Valentine \n\n \nDo you agree or disagree with this article?

The potential megawattages have been reported, so those \nspeed data must be available. Valentine should put them in.\n  \n William Quaintance\n3.21.06  What about the impact on \nsea animals? Unlike with wind, heavy ocean currents attract high concentrations \nof ocean life. The impact on ocean life per MW generated will probably be much \nhigher than wind, unless the turbines spin much slower. And large animals might \nbe impacted by even slow turbines. This subject will need research.\n  \n Roger Bedard\n3.21.06  Two questions for the author \n 1. The first sentence says that \"An announcement was made during late \nFebruary in Bermuda advising that construction was to begin on an undersea \nwindmill installation that will provide up to 10% of Bermuda's \nelectricity\" I ask the author to confirm whether it is in fact \n\"permitting\" and not \"construction\" that is to begin as it \nis my understanding that a permit and license must be obtained before \ncontruction can begin.\n 2. I ask the author why he chose to cite the Muskeget Channel site as the \nonly example of a North America in stream tidal site when in fact the Muskeget \nChannel energy resource is probably not worth harnessing (because of low energy \nresource and high cost of grid interconnection) and ignored mentioning dozens \nof others including those in the Bay of Fundy, Cook Inlet, Northwest Passage, \nPuget Sound and San Francisco Bay\n  \n Graham Cowan\n3.21.06  Birds are much denser than air \nand to stay up in it must maintain a high mass flow ot it past them that they \ndivert downward; they must fly fast. Sea creatures are at or very near neutral \nbuoyancy, so don't have to go fast, so would not tend to die like birds on \nstriking a turbine blade. (And predictable strong air windsdo, surely, \nattract migrating birds.) So if, as I don't expect, seawater flow turbines were \nto be built, they would harm only investors, not fish.\n \n--- Graham Cowan, former hydrogen fan\nB: internal combustion, nuclear \ncachet \n  \n\n \n \n  \nAdd your comments: \nPlease log in to leave a comment!\n \n\n\n \n  Top \n\n\n\n\n\n Sponsored Content \n\n\n \n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Home | Register | Subscribe | Contribute | \nAdvertise | About Us | Feedback \n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Copyright \u00a9 \n2002-2012, CyberTech, Inc. - All rights reserved.

Tits are particularly happy to use boxes \nand are always a delight.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nNestboxes are excellent substitutes for the holes found in old trees. In \nmany parks and gardens there may be plenty of food for small birds but nowhere \nfor them to nest. \nWhich birds will use a nestbox? \nOver 60 species are known to have used nestboxes, including of course Blue \nand Great Tits. Among the others are Coal Tits, Nuthatches, House and Tree \nSparrows, Starlings, Spotted Flycatchers, Robins, House Martins, Kestrels and \nTawny Owls. Much depends on where the box is and on your surroundings. For \ncomprehensive information on nestbox design, seeNestboxes by Chris du \nFeu, BTO Guide 23, obtainable from the National Centre for Ornithology, The \nNunnery, Thetford, Norfolk IP24 2PU. Tel 01842 750050.\n\n\u00a0 \nHow do I make a nestbox? \nNatural nest holes do not come in standard sizes, so use the following \ndimensions only as a guide. The type of wood used to make a box is not critical \nbut remember that a box made from cedar, oak or beech will far outlive one made \nfrom softwood such as pine. Much more important\u00a0 is the thickness of the \nwood: 19mm is ideal, and it should not be less than 15mm.\u00a0\nUse a plank about 150 mm wide and 15 mm thick. The size of each section to \nbe cut is shown on the diagram. The inside of the box must be at least 100 mm \nsquare and the bottom of the entrance hole must be at least 125 mm from the \nfloor. If it is less, young birds might be scooped out by a cat.\nUse galvanised nails or screws. The inside front surface should be rough to \nallow the young birds to clamber up. A drainage hole should be drilled in the \nbase.\nThe entrance hole size depends on the species you hope to attract: 25 mm \nfor Coal, Marsh and Blue Tits, 28 mm for Great Tits and 32 mm for Nuthatches, \nHouse and Tree Sparrows, Pied Flycatcher,45mm for Starling, 200mm Stock Dove, \nTawny Owl, Jackdaw. Open for Robin, Wren (if well hidden) Blackbird, Spotted \nFlycatcher, Pied Wagtail, and Song Thrush.\nHinge the lid with a strip of leather or rubber (an old piece of bicycle \ninner tube would do). Do not nail the lid down but use a good catch to fasten \nit. You will want to clean out the box in the autumn.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOpen: The same box with the upper half of the front taken away altogether \nmay attract the occasional robin, pied wagtail or wren to nest. Spotted \nflycatchers prefer an even shallower, open-fronted box.\nWhat can I use to treat the wood?\u00a0\n Softwood boxes may be treated with water-based paints such as Fenceguard. \nApply any wood preservative only to the outside of the box, and not around the \nentrance hole. Whatever you use, make sure the box dries and airs thoroughly \nbefore putting it up. \nWhere should the box be placed?\nFix the box 1.5m to 5.5 metres high (5ft - 18ft) up a tree or wall, out of \nthe reach of cats (even higher if you high cat population) and curious humans! \nUnless there are trees or buildings which give permanent shelter, it is best \nfacing between north and south-east, thus avoiding strong sunlight and the \nwettest winds: Tilt the box forward slightly so that any driving rain will hit \nthe roof and bounce clear. House Sparrows and Starlings will readily use \nnestboxes placed high up under the eaves and these will often deter the birds \nfrom nesting in your roof! But keep away from areas where house martins \nnormally nest. Open nest boxes require more cover and some birds such as Robins \nprefer a low nest site; siting them near to climbing plants where they can be \npartially obscured if possible i.e. such as fence covered in Ivy or within a \nhedge\u00a0 Siting your nest box near vegetation also aids young birds taking \ntheir first flights as it gives them both physical support and good cover. In \ngardens without trees then fitting them to the side of a shed or a wall is the \nnext best option \n Ivy & spiked belt that circles the trunk.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ivy cover.\nIf the box has not been occupied after two breeding seasons, consider \nre-erecting it in a different position site. Remember occupancy also depends on \nwhat birds are in the area, availability of natural nesting sites and what the \nneighbours have already erected, disappointing but sometimes the your 'des res' \ndoesn't get chosen.\nHow should I attach my nestbox to a tree? \nFixing your nestbox with nails may damage the tree. It is better to attach \nit with wire around the trunk or branch. Use a piece of hose or section of car \ntyre around the wire to prevent damage to the tree. Remember that trees grow in \ngirth as well as height, and check any fixing every two or three years. \nHow close together can nestboxes be positioned? \nTwo boxes of the same kind may both be occupied if they are at the edge of \nadjoining territories and if there is plenty of natural food. Tits can, \nhowever, be very aggressive and seldom nest at densities greater than two or \nthree pairs per acre. You may get tits to nest in one box and robins or wrens \nin another type nearby. \nA nest box should never be sited close to a bird table or bird feeders, as \nlarge numbers of feeding birds will disturb potential nesting pairs.\u00a0 \nShould the nestbox be cleaned out each year? \nDo not open a box between the breeding season February\u00a0 to \nAugust. Birds may abandon eggs and young if disturbed\nThe nests of most birds harbour fleas and other parasites which remain to \ninfest young birds that hatch the following year. We recommend that old nests \nare removed in October or November. Use boiling water to kill any remaining \nparasites. Insecticides and flea powders must not be used. \nIf there are unhatched eggs in the box, these may be removed legally only \nbetween October and January, and must be disposed of. \nIf you place a small handful of clean hay or wood shavings (not straw) in \nthe box once it is thoroughly dry after cleaning, it may be used during the \nwinter by small mammals or birds for hibernating or roosting respectively.\nWhy were there dead young or unhatched eggs in the box?\nIt is quite normal for a few eggs to fail to hatch, or for some young to \ndie. Blue and great tits lay up to 14 eggs to allow for such losses. Cold \nweather and food shortage may lead to nest desertion, or to only the strongest \nyoung surviving. The death of one parent or interference from animals or humans \nmay also cause desertion.\u00a0\u00a0**Helping food\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How can I keep predators away from my \nnestbox?\u00a0\u00a0  \nNestbox predators include cats, squirrels, rats, mice, stoats, weasels, \nwoodpeckers and members of the crow family. As predators mainly hunt early in \nthe morning, most people are unaware of their presence. A metal plate fixed \naround the entrance hole may deter woodpeckers and squirrels, while barbed \nwire, gorse or rose clippings above and below the box will give some protection \nagainst most mammals. The repellent Renardine, mixed with sawdust, effectively \nkeeps many mammals away (but not squirrels). The BTO guide already mentioned \ncontains extra information on resolving this problem. \nProtect nesting birds from tree-climbing cats with this spiked belt that \ncircles the trunk. Adapts for different tree \ncircumferences.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nHow can I prevent sparrows from frightening the tits away?\nMost tits are able to defend a box successfully, provided that the sparrows \ncannot get inside. A hole size of 25 mm will exclude any sparrow. Do not fix a \nperch on the front of your box as this will encourage sparrows. Tits do not \nneed a perch. \nWhy do tits hammer away at the entrance hole?\nThis is probably a form of display by the male, rather than an attempt to \nenlarge the hole. Later, the female will also peck vigorously: natural holes \nmay have all the surrounding bark chipped away. This may help her to judge how \nsoft the wood is and whether the hole will provide a safe, predator-proof home \nin which to raise her brood. Blue and great tits will also hammer at the inside \nof a box or nest hole, perhaps as a form of display. Other the Nesting \nbehavioural clues are nesting wriggles and wing fanning, only done by the \nfemale.\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n Why do tits enter nestboxes in autumn and winter?\nThey may be looking for a suitable place to sleep or perhaps feed. Roosting \nboxes are often subsequently used for nesting. Birds like to 'check out' a \npotential nest box early to ensure that they are suitable, therefore Nestboxes \nerected before the breeding season begins (February) are therefore more likely \nto be used. Tits will not seriously inspect potential nest sites until February \nor March. \nHow can I prevent insects from taking over a nestbox?\nA word of caution, take care when opening your nest box; Bees, wasps or \nearwigs will, on occasions, take over nestboxes and there is little one can do \nto prevent it - apart from using insect sprays. As many of the insects are \nuseful food for birds, it is best to leave well alone. Insects often move in \nafter birds have finished nesting. Any dead young found are likely to have \nfailed because of other natural causes. Despite thorough cleaning, it is not \nunusual for the same type of insect to return to the box in subsequent years. \nSo leave that box in situ and put up another one a few feet away. It is rare \nindeed for both to be lost to insect invasion! \nRSPB Warning February 2009: \n \n Nestboxes - the good, the bad and the ugly \n\u00a0\nQuirky, attractive and elaborate bird boxes are not necessarily safe or \neffective for nesting birds.\nIn some cases, unsuitable nestboxes made with the wrong material or a poor \ndesign could lead to injury and even death.\nGardeners around the UK will put up nextboxes this month in good time for \nthe breeding season. The RSPB is asking that they make sure the ones they \nchoose are the right size, shape and material.\nBoxes shaped like caravans, farmhouses, eggs, windmills and even fruit are \non sale as nesting sites for garden birds. But although they might make a \nquirky feature in your garden, they could actually be dangerous for young birds.\n\nMany are made from materials that also look attractive, but are completely \nunsuitable for nesting birds \u2013 such as ceramics which are not good for \ninsulation or brightly coloured materials which do not make the box \ninconspicuous to predators.\nNestboxes with metal roofs retain too much heat and can literally bake baby \nbirds to death on sunny days. Metal and plastic nestboxes suffer from \ncondensation causing baby birds to get damp and cold.\nIan Hayward, RSPB Wildlife Advisor, says: \u201cThere are so many elaborate \nnestboxes on sale that look the part but are really quite dangerous to nesting \nbirds. Don\u2019t be tempted to go for the unusual shapes and colours \u2013 \ntraditional, wooden nestboxes really are the best \u2013 and often the most \ncost effective too.\n\u201cNestboxes are out in all weather so they need to be strong, robust, \nwaterproof and have good insulation. They also need to have the correct hole \nsize.\n\u201cPeople tend to forget that a nestbox will eventually contain tiny \nhelpless, vulnerable baby birds and the appearance of the box should be the \nlast thing on your mind.\u201d\nThe RSPB is suggesting some nestbox dos and don\u2019ts:\nThey should:\n- Be robust \u2013 they are out in all weather and need to be strong and \nfit for purpose\n- Be waterproof \u2013 they need to be treated with a water-based \npreservative\n- Have the correct hole-size \u2013 if too large predators will easily get \ninside and rain/wind will get into the box\n- Be safe \u2013 no dangerous sharp edges, protruding nails or staples or \nunecessary fixtures or small gaps which\u00a0may harm or trap birds\n-Have good insulation \u2013 wood or woodcrete is usually the best material\n\n- Have no perches\nThey should not:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be brightly \ncoloured \u2013 the more inconspicuous the better\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be made from flimsy \nmaterial \u2013 many boxes fall apart when any weight is put inside\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be too shallow \n\u2013 young birds could leave prematurely by falling out\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be too deep - young \nbirds may have problems getting out when they are ready\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be too smooth on \nthe inside \u2013 slippery material will also make it difficult for young birds \nto get out\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have gaps \u2013 \nrain and cold air will get in and cause young birds to get cold and damp\nThe RSPB also recommends that nestboxes are positioned where it isn\u2019t \neasy for predators such as cats to access them and where there isn\u2019t too \nmuch sunlight.\nThey should be cleaned out each autumn and have fresh hay or wood shavings \nadded as a potential winter roost site.\nTo find out more about nestboxes and where to site them visit \nwww.rspb.org.uk.

Whenever an oil spill occurs in the Pacific \nNorthwest, she drives out to the coast to volunteer her services to clean the \noil-soaked wildlife.\nOil spills occur with increasing frequency these days and her descriptions \nof these self-funded travels sometimes sounds as if she were an angel traveling \nan eco-circuit in Hell. With her arms immersed up to her elbows in warm soapy \nwater, fingers lathering and massaging a mound of wriggling feathers, always on \nguard against a quick jab from a razor sharp beak, she coos sweet nothings into \nthe ear of an incapacitated cormorant or murre that shivers on the edge of \nshock. It's not difficult to conjure up the likes of Saint Francis and the \nVirgin Mary standing at adjoining sinks.\nIn my innocence, it has always been easy to believe that everyone else \nagrees with this saintly assessment of her compassionate deed. But when I \nquestioned her after a recent foray, I was astonished to learn that the \npractice of bird washing has started to receive some criticism. The friendliest \nof these critics would prefer to replace my image of Saint Francis with that of \nDon Quixote involved in an ecological act as futile as jousting with windmills. \nThe more vituperative critics decribe her as an animal rights version of Sad \nSack, that old cartoon character who means well but whose every move gums up \nthe works.\nThe fact is, an increasing number of environmentalists, wildlife managers, \nand research biologists believe that bird washing is a useless endeavor that \nempowers individual washers while deflecting sorely needed publicity and \nresources from the more essential work of saving species and abolishing \nanti-ecological energy policies.\nIt got me wondering. Why wash birds? If the issue is defined in the usual \ngrown-up manner of how much personal time and money we ought to disburse to \nsave \"just\" a few hundred individual birds that represent \n\"just\" common species, the judgment is going to depend on how anybody \nvalues either their own time or their own money. On another level, establishing \nvalues in terms of time and money seems emblematic of the way that the \nmainstream\u2013including politicians, oil company executives, and even \nenvironmental fundraisers\u2013always find a way to transmute a compassionate \nactivity like washing birds into economic terms.\nThe collectivization of compassion\n\n Why wash birds? When I put the question to my friend in terms of \nvalue, she quickly answered that two longtime Washington State volunteers were \nable to take the skills gained from washing birds in the Pacific Northwest to \nArgentina, where they set up a clinic to save the highly endangered Magellenic \nPenguins who were dying en masse from a recent oil spill. Her answer was \ndisappointing. It sounded like an apology; as if a good press agent had coached \nher to advance large societal implications for what was actually a very \npersonal commitment. In this case, the key terms defining societal value had \naltered from \"time and money\" to \"highly endangered\" and \n\"en masse\".\nI, too, get stuck sometimes in a mythical world view that makes me believe \nthat people are inherently reasonable and that, deep down, everyone wants to \nlook upon nature with a respect akin to the spiritual. If I could only reach \nthem, talk to them, air my own personal revelations about nature, human \npopulation levels would inevitably decrease and the environment would soon be \nsaved. Unfortunately, my galloping idealism throw me into profound confusion \nwhen ideas and issues do not fit this view.\nTake the word \"compassion\". I listen to my friend describe the \ncompassion enacted in Argentina, and actually hear \"compromise\" and \n\"dispassion\". It seems that those aforementioned limitations of time \nand energy loosened up funding that eventually dictated that the volunteers \nfocus their own time and energy on washing penguins while permitting more \ncommon species to perish. In other words, it make a difference to wash fifty \nbirds representing a species numbering just ten thousand members; whereas \nwashing a different fifty birds is a useless activity when the species numbers \nfive million members. My friend told me that the orthodox environmental \nmovement heartily supports this hierarchical model of compassion, founded, as \nit is, upon the endangered status of any species. Who would do it any \ndifferently?\nProfessional environmentalists who criticize the non-discriminating bird \nwashers often couch their own point of view in a tricky euphemistic language \nthat makes them sound both hands-on and activist. Their fundraising literature \nis loud with claims about doing the best and the most, as if they were selling \nsafety features on automobiles. But closer analysis of their hands on, activist \ndeclarations shows these people to be distinctly hands off and aloof, because \nthey irrevocably deny either rights or sentience to individual animals. The \nmost articulate prefer to re-channel all motivation, away from compassion which \nfocuses on individual animals, and toward non-individualistic terms like \nbiodiversity and species extinction. One caveat: by no stretch of the \nimagination, am I trying to suggest that either of these important terms is \nsuperficial. I simply wish to put a skewed spin on their meaning, based on my \nquirky suspicions about the semantics of compassion.\nThe 6.8 Billion is us\nIn an ideal world, the collectivization of compassion would seem a strange \ncredo, although it starts to make sense in a world whose parts are utterly \ncontrolled by humanity\u2013but which individual humans, themselves, are \nincapable of controlling. Conventional wisdom concludes that our very sanity \nsometimes depends upon each one of us developing an ability to distance \nourselves from the catastrophe we happen to live inside of. Showing obeisance \nto collective nouns and pragmatic values certainly helps achieve that end. \nUnfortunately, focusing all our attention on large overriding problems offers \nlittle incentive, and not much hope for individual action in a world where the \ncumulative activities of 6.8 billion human beings are impacting everything \neverywhere all the time.

The way members of one movement view \nmembers from the other would make a revealing study of environmentalism as the \none true faith.\nThe environmentalists are further split between the proponents of \nconservation and of preservation. In simple terms, conservation signifies [wise \nuse by humans] while preservation means humans ought to stay away and let \nnature heal itself. When it comes to the collectivization of compassion, The \ndistinction between conservationists and preservationists leads to a tactile \nparadox. Though the conservationists would have us keep our collective hands on \nthe animals for [wise use], their resource-intensive stance actually promotes a \ndistancing from individual animals. By contrast, the preservationists hands-off \nstance actually treats animals as beings possessed of their own rights and \nrelationships. Hands-off diminishes the distance; hands-on increases it.\nMy friend tells me it is not only the environmentalists who take exception \nto her close-up, nose-to-beak, cooing-in-the-ear approach to animals. Bird \nwashers are much more often rebuked by the scientific establishment, who \naccuses them of being anthropomorphic \u2013 meaning that we should reserve \nour perceptions about individuality (and the resultant caring) exclusively for \nother humans. The verdict of the scientific establishment on bird washing, \nhowever it is stated, implies that birds are mostly instinctoids quite \nincapable of comprehending their own mortality, let alone the exigencies of \nhuman compassion. This perception of birds requires that the bird washers be \ndepicted as naive romantics living in a cartoon world where birds operate by \nthe same emotions as human beings and are thus [thankful] for our intercession. \nBut ironically, anthropomorphism is alive and well in our culture, and there \nare likewise plenty of folks who depict the detractors of bird washing as \nanother kind of cartoon character \u2013 the dispassionate villains who would \nbe happy to incinerate all the pathetic instinctoids.\nIt has never been clear to me why the scientific method necessitates a \ndisdain for all things anthropomorphic; why an emotional distancing from other \nspecies is deemed the road leading to truth. I wonder whether the \nanti-anthropomorphic scientific worldview \u2013 a philosophy unique to modern \nculture \u2013 isn\u2019t counterproductive to environmental healing because \nit impels our society to distance itself from nature and thus lends support for \nthe exploitation of nature. If this troubling idea has merit, then we might \nconclude that the codified distancing practiced by science is what causes oil \nspills to occur in the first place.\nSorting out all the philosophical camps only leads to more confusion. My \nbird washing friend assures me that all the various ethical stances are created \nin response to the one and only environmental crisis. She insists that this \ncrisis is best understood as a breakdown in the way individual human beings \nperceive nature, and that each one of us needs to start relating to such \ncreatures as oil-soaked seabirds as if they were real neighbors fallen victim \nto our own (yours and mine) real greed and folly.

Whenever an oil spill occurs in the Pacific \nNorthwest, she drives out to the coast to volunteer her services to clean the \noil-soaked wildlife.\nOil spills occur with increasing frequency these days and her descriptions \nof these self-funded travels sometimes sounds as if she were an angel traveling \nan eco-circuit in Hell. With her arms immersed up to her elbows in warm soapy \nwater, fingers lathering and massaging a mound of wriggling feathers, always on \nguard against a quick jab from a razor sharp beak, she coos sweet nothings into \nthe ear of an incapacitated cormorant or murre that shivers on the edge of \nshock. It's not difficult to conjure up the likes of Saint Francis and the \nVirgin Mary standing at adjoining sinks.\nIn my innocence, it has always been easy to believe that everyone else \nagrees with this saintly assessment of her compassionate deed. But when I \nquestioned her after a recent foray, I was astonished to learn that the \npractice of bird washing has started to receive some criticism. The friendliest \nof these critics would prefer to replace my image of Saint Francis with that of \nDon Quixote involved in an ecological act as futile as jousting with windmills. \nThe more vituperative critics decribe her as an animal rights version of Sad \nSack, that old cartoon character who means well but whose every move gums up \nthe works.\nThe fact is, an increasing number of environmentalists, wildlife managers, \nand research biologists believe that bird washing is a useless endeavor that \nempowers individual washers while deflecting sorely needed publicity and \nresources from the more essential work of saving species and abolishing \nanti-ecological energy policies.\nIt got me wondering. Why wash birds? If the issue is defined in the usual \ngrown-up manner of how much personal time and money we ought to disburse to \nsave \"just\" a few hundred individual birds that represent \n\"just\" common species, the judgment is going to depend on how anybody \nvalues either their own time or their own money. On another level, establishing \nvalues in terms of time and money seems emblematic of the way that the \nmainstream\u2013including politicians, oil company executives, and even \nenvironmental fundraisers\u2013always find a way to transmute a compassionate \nactivity like washing birds into economic terms.\nThe collectivization of compassion\n\n Why wash birds? When I put the question to my friend in terms of \nvalue, she quickly answered that two longtime Washington State volunteers were \nable to take the skills gained from washing birds in the Pacific Northwest to \nArgentina, where they set up a clinic to save the highly endangered Magellenic \nPenguins who were dying en masse from a recent oil spill. Her answer was \ndisappointing. It sounded like an apology; as if a good press agent had coached \nher to advance large societal implications for what was actually a very \npersonal commitment. In this case, the key terms defining societal value had \naltered from \"time and money\" to \"highly endangered\" and \n\"en masse\".\nI, too, get stuck sometimes in a mythical world view that makes me believe \nthat people are inherently reasonable and that, deep down, everyone wants to \nlook upon nature with a respect akin to the spiritual. If I could only reach \nthem, talk to them, air my own personal revelations about nature, human \npopulation levels would inevitably decrease and the environment would soon be \nsaved. Unfortunately, my galloping idealism throw me into profound confusion \nwhen ideas and issues do not fit this view.\nTake the word \"compassion\". I listen to my friend describe the \ncompassion enacted in Argentina, and actually hear \"compromise\" and \n\"dispassion\". It seems that those aforementioned limitations of time \nand energy loosened up funding that eventually dictated that the volunteers \nfocus their own time and energy on washing penguins while permitting more \ncommon species to perish. In other words, it make a difference to wash fifty \nbirds representing a species numbering just ten thousand members; whereas \nwashing a different fifty birds is a useless activity when the species numbers \nfive million members. My friend told me that the orthodox environmental \nmovement heartily supports this hierarchical model of compassion, founded, as \nit is, upon the endangered status of any species. Who would do it any \ndifferently?\nProfessional environmentalists who criticize the non-discriminating bird \nwashers often couch their own point of view in a tricky euphemistic language \nthat makes them sound both hands-on and activist. Their fundraising literature \nis loud with claims about doing the best and the most, as if they were selling \nsafety features on automobiles. But closer analysis of their hands on, activist \ndeclarations shows these people to be distinctly hands off and aloof, because \nthey irrevocably deny either rights or sentience to individual animals. The \nmost articulate prefer to re-channel all motivation, away from compassion which \nfocuses on individual animals, and toward non-individualistic terms like \nbiodiversity and species extinction. One caveat: by no stretch of the \nimagination, am I trying to suggest that either of these important terms is \nsuperficial. I simply wish to put a skewed spin on their meaning, based on my \nquirky suspicions about the semantics of compassion.\nThe 6.8 Billion is us\nIn an ideal world, the collectivization of compassion would seem a strange \ncredo, although it starts to make sense in a world whose parts are utterly \ncontrolled by humanity\u2013but which individual humans, themselves, are \nincapable of controlling. Conventional wisdom concludes that our very sanity \nsometimes depends upon each one of us developing an ability to distance \nourselves from the catastrophe we happen to live inside of. Showing obeisance \nto collective nouns and pragmatic values certainly helps achieve that end. \nUnfortunately, focusing all our attention on large overriding problems offers \nlittle incentive, and not much hope for individual action in a world where the \ncumulative activities of 6.8 billion human beings are impacting everything \neverywhere all the time. Dealing with environmental problems in collective \nlanguage dulls our senses to the possibilities of what any single individual \ncould do to help.\nFailing on every Front\n\n Environmentalists and wildlife managers tell us that every year, ever \nmore devastating environmental tragedies occur ever more often, continually \ncausing us to redefine our very concept of the inconceivable. What were once \nconsidered tragedies are now hardly considered at all. For example, significant \noil spills are occurring two or three times each month in US coastal waters and \nyet they rarely make the newspapers.

They're \ncalled algae. And they stubbornly occur in water - the one place in a landscape \nthat shouldn't look green. But what are algae? Where did they come from? What \nkind of damage can they do? And are they really that bad?\nThe problem of algae is hard to escape - algae are everywhere. More than \n30,000 varieties have been discovered, and scientists have found that algae \nhave been around for at least two billion years. They occur in virtually every \nhabitat on earth, as long as water and sunlight are found there, even if the \nwater is present for a very short time. They can survive severe environments, \nfrom icy mountain glaciers to boiling hot springs to excessively salty water. \nHowever, for the purposes of this article, we will limit ourselves to algae \nthat grow in ponds, lakes, and streams.\nSo what are algae? You'll notice that we've been using the plural form to \ntalk about them - one alga is microscopic; masses of hundreds of millions of \nalga are called algae. It's these masses that we see when we look at a lake, \nand it's these masses that are the real enemy. Algae are traditionally \nconsidered to be simple, primitive plants, some made of only one or two cells. \nMost make their own food materials through photosynthesis using sunlight, \nwater, and carbon dioxide - just like any other plant. While they also contain \nchlorophyll and produce oxygen, all lack the leaves, roots, and flowers \nassociated with the more familiar higher plant forms.\nAlgae can float freely in water, coloring it green, or they can coat the \nsides of a pond with a green or brownish slime. In the ocean, they provide the \nfood base for most marine food chains. Without algae, our waters would not \nsustain life and mankind would not benefit from its countless qualities and \nboundless beauty. However, in very high densities (called algal blooms) algae \nnot only discolors water, but can also outcompete or poison other life forms in \nit.\nBut how did it get to your pond or pool? That can be answered with another \nquestion: where did you get your water? All water - even purified drinking \nwater - can have algae in it. Algae can form spores, which are special, \nmicroscopic, and very tough cells that can survive just about anything - even \nthe local water purification system. Local water companies will kill nearly all \nof the algae in water, but some is bound to survive, and it only takes a single \nspore to birth a huge, visible, mucky colony. Algae can also enter a pond with \nfish, fish food, or just about anything else you put inside.\nThe most common kind of algae is called planktonic algae. These are the \nsingle-celled culprits that create most algal blooms, although they also \nbedevil pond owners worldwide. They reproduce rapidly, and can be green, brown, \nor red in color. They can be toxic to animals and can give water an unpleasant \ntaste or odor.\nSpirogyra are another common type of algae. These algae look like strings \nor filaments, and are familiar as being the green \"hair\" on the \nrocks, sides, or bottom of a pond. There are more than four hundred species of \nSpirogyra worldwide, adapted to a variety of environments, but are not as \nlikely to \"bloom\" as planktonic algae.\nPlanktonic algae will bloom in nutrient-rich water. Nutrients can be \nproduced by a few fish, heavy feeding of fish, or even bird traffic. Any of \nthese circumstances can throw off the balance of a pond's ecosystem, and algae \nwill quickly take advantage of that imbalance, growing rapidly and dying back \nwhen the nutrients are depleted. Even non-toxic chemicals such as those running \noff of a farmer's field have been found to cause algal blooms. If non-toxic \nrunoff from a landscape is reaching a pond, or even the rocks surrounding a \npond, it might be inviting an algae explosion.\nThis can be a problem even after the algae die back. They can sink to the \nbottom of a pool or pond and form sludge. A lot of sludge - a couple acre feet \nof water can easily sustain growth of several tons of algae per season. This \nwill decrease your water volume over time and possibly necessitate dredging.\nAs the dead algae decompose, the decomposition may cause oxygen depletion \nin the deeper waters. This can result in fish kills, or even chemical changes \nin the mud on the bottom, which could release chemicals or toxic gases. Some \nspecies of algae even produce neurotoxins, which, if present in a high enough \nconcentration of water, can cause serious health problems in humans if that \nwater is ingested.\nNaturally, those are extreme instances. But smaller amounts of algae are \nnot without their own hazards. For one, algae aren't aesthetically pleasing. \nThey can make a pristine pond look like a cloudy, stagnant bowl of pea soup. \nThey can also make rocks or hard surfaces extremely slippery, especially a \nproblem around pools. They can clog screens, filters, or pipelines, plug \nirrigation or pumping equipment, and stain and rot wood. They can also lessen \nwater flow and trap unsightly debris.\nIn small amounts in natural environments, algae are an important part of \nthe ecosystem, providing an essential link in the food chain. However, in \nrecreational or aesthetic water features, they can be a serious problem that \nneeds to be dealt with aggressively.\nBy Denne Goldstein and Rebecca Peterson\nSource: Irrigation and Green Magazine, July 2006, www.igin.com \n\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nReturn Policy\nShipping Info \n\nDistributor Inquiries\nCorporate\nAssociations\nFrequently Asked Questions\nSite Map \n\nIn the Press\nArticles\nWhat are microbial products?\nKoi & Water Garden Gallery\nEnvironmental Services \n\nQuick Order\nMetric Converter \n \n\n\nblog\n\nFacebook\n\ntwitter\n \n \n  \n \u00a9 2011 Copyright Natural Environmental Systems, LLC.

Oil Can Harry replied to Liz \n Tue 17 Jan 12 \n(03:03pm) \nA US study1 published in 2001 carried out by Western \n Ecosystems Technology puts wind turbine collisions into \n perspective with bird collisions with other structures : \n \u2022 \n Vehicles: 60 million - 80 million \n \u2022 \n Buildings and Windows: 98 million - 980 million \n \u2022 \n Powerlines: tens of thousands - 174 million \n \u2022 \n Communication Towers: 4 million - 50 million \n \u2022 \n Wind Generation Facilities: 10,000 - 40,000 \n The study estimates that wind farms kill an average of \n 2.9 birds per turbine, per year in the US \u2013 equivalent to \n less than 0.02 percent of the staggering 200-500 million \n collision related deaths in that country.

Or do you honestly believe \nWestern forces cruise around nuking Iraqi suburbs from orbit?\n If the Greens had their way Iraq would have been abandoned to their fate. \nToo bad if the streets ran with the blood of the innocent as brutal tribal law \ntook over because Bob Brown has a nice wood fire in his little Tasmanian cabin.\n\n Greens Evil?? I think you should more be arguing why they are not. \nJ.H. replied to Liz \n Wed 18 Jan 12 (12:11am) \nNo Paul, Michael Mann created statistical nonsense and tried to call it \nscience.

These birds aren\u2019t being \u201ckilled.\u201d \n Nasty hunters kill birds. \n No, these birds are sacrificial offerings to the greater glory of Gaia, \nand thus their deaths are perfectly acceptable to her followers. \nTadpole of Tomakin (Reply) \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (10:39am) \nRichard D replied to Tadpole \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (12:02pm) \nA few eggs need to be broken to make an omelet? \n Somehow I think we might be waiting a while for abc or smh to pick up this \nstory. If millions of birds died from a oil spill or nuclear fallout, they \nwould be all over it.\n And I don\u2019t expect the animal rights people to take much notice of \nthis either\n At least the birds can take comfort that they weren\u2019t killed by some \nform of Capitalist exploitation but by an environmental firendly propellor.\nBrendan replied to Tadpole \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (12:13pm) \nSpot on tadpole.\u00a0 And the added bonus is that these birds breathe out \nCO2 and their farts contain methane.\n So executing them with windfarms reduces CO2 and methane emissions. \n Its win win for our Greens!  ianb replied to Tadpole \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (12:26pm) \nAnd how \u2018beautiful\u2019 a sacrifice that Eagle is - not!. \n Such a shame to see an awesome and majestic creature uselessly killed by a \nuseless Green initiative that will acomplish nothing but more national debt.\n I guess it is OK by the Greentards though, after all, an Eagle is a \nmeateater and therefore evil. Charles WA replied to Tadpole\n Tue 17 Jan 12 (01:23pm) \nYes Richard D that is the danger of the sinister PC censorship \n which \nprefers ordinary people to live in a delusion.\n A PC delusion. \n PC - that terrible insistence that some things must remain \n unsayable \neven if they are patently true.\n PC - the system of censorship which has settled over Australia like a \ndense cloud of phosgene gas or an iron curtain.\n Censorship which is about \nto lowered further by this PC government and its accomplices and activists.\n Australians should be fully aware their democratic right to \n know and \nfreedom of speech is under serious attack by this\n worst government ever. \n Burn of the Glen replied to Tadpole \n Tue 17 Jan 12 \n(05:41pm) \n@RicharD \n Sorry mate, it is capitalist exploitation! \nIt would be interesting to know how many migratory birds fall victim to \noff-shore oil rigs; as a comparison point. \n I will say that the difference between six and eighteen million is \nconsiderable; almost to the point where I\u2019d be hypothesising that \nit\u2019s merely a guess.

The prediction of 6-18 million bird deaths a year \nsounds as fanciful as 100m sea level rise and the oceans becoming a festering \npool of acid.\n I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to counter the chicken little \nhysteria of climate change with similarly baseless predictions. jum\n replied to Cybrarian Pete \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (01:04pm) \n\u201cBut once Drymon analyzed the feathers in the lab, he was fairly sure \nthey had come from a terrestrial bird.\u201d FAIRLY SURE\u201d?????\n So these brainiacs go off and kill 50 tiger sharks so they can blame the \noil rigs\n \u201cSo Drymon and his team launched a project to study the \nsharks\u2019 diets. Over two years the team caught 50 tiger \nsharks\u2014mostly within 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16 kilometers) \noffshore\u2014and dissected their stomachs.\u201d\n Bit like the Japanese research on whales  tweety \nreplied to Cybrarian Pete\n Tue 17 Jan 12 (01:13pm) \nhmmm...i agree lets stop all industries that kill animals, including there \nhabitat.\n Let me go grab my club. \n\nmight be killing six million to 18 million birds and bats a year\n\n That is a bit fanciful and ummmm BS! \n \u201cmight\u201d????? \n \n16 to 18 million????\n Come on, please give us something a little bit more credible.  \nCybrarian Pete replied to Cybrarian Pete \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (01:16pm) \n@ spareme \n Spare me your glib response.\u00a0 I am interested in hard data on bird \ndeaths, not speculation or editorialising. Toad of Toad Hall\n replied to Cybrarian Pete \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (02:28pm) \nInteresting theory about the oil-rigs. \n However, you \nshould do further research \u2026. This NatGeo article is based upon a few \nfeathers found in the guts of one shark, followed by lots of \n\u2018join-the-dots\u2019 speculation by some Enviro-Nut, with the not \nsurprising conclusion that BIG OIL is making sharks eat birds.\n On the \nother hand, the jury is in on wind-farms.\n Wind turbine blades look \ndeceptively slow moving from a distance but few people know that the blade tip \nof a medium sized turbine travels at around 250 kmh \u2013 275 kmh \u2026. \nmore than a match for a budgie.\n There is a wind-farm near where I live \nco-owned by the local Green-leaning council. They have always had weekly \npick-ups of deceased animals (usually the losers of kangaroo vs holden car \ndisputes) but they are quietly picking up the dead birds from under the \nturbines daily so that no-one sees a build-up of bird corpses.\nThe day a whale runs into the blade of a wind turbine is the day Bob Brown \nstarts being concerned about it. Ant of Melbourne (Reply) \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (10:43am) Bob Campbell replied to Ant \n \nTue 17 Jan 12 (11:59am) \nWell Ant, last year a European offshore wind farm was blamed for confusing \na pod of whales who beached themselves and died.\n Oh the irony of it. \nSodapoppy replied to Ant \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (12:08pm) \nThe day Bobo Brown is concerned is the day a windmill damages any part of \nhis property Allan replied to Ant \n Tue 17 Jan 12 \n(12:24pm) \nWhales are hit by ship propellors all the time. \n These anti-civilisation freaks will want to stop shipping next. \nThe Greens?!

Centurion replied to Peter \n \nWed 18 Jan 12 (05:29am) \nJust drove by a windfarm near Palm Springs in California. It\u2019s \namazing how many of the windmills are not working - and there\u2019s a gale \nblowing. Looking at them it\u2019s pretty obvious the ones not working are \nolder ones so assuming they are broken is most likely fair. There\u2019s so \nmany of them. Has anyone done a total cost of operating ones of these things \nfrom birth to death? My guess is that they NEVER repay the cost to the \nenvironment of manufacturing them. Just like electric cars. But we can feel \ngood about them so that\u2019s okay.\nLooked to me like a Californian Condor which is on the verge of \nextinction.\u00a0 These wind turbines are useless, ugly and are a harm to the \nenviroment.\u00a0 What green plan isn\u2019t Yovee of glen iris\n (Reply) \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (10:52am) \nWho doesn\u2019t hate bird shredders.  carissa of brisbane\n (Reply) \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (10:52am) Formerly \nreplied to carissa\n Tue 17 Jan 12 (12:07pm) \nI drove to Canberra the other week and they are springing up all over the \nhills beside Lake George - I detest the things and wonder how any rational \nperson could think they are wonderful.\u00a0\n I wonder how much it would cost to get a blasting ticket\u2026 \nvote1leftard replied to carissa \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (01:57pm) \nNo need for a blasting ticket,a 9\"angle grinder or gas axe will \n\u201cdrop\u201d a bird shreeder in minutes.

How many \nreaders use food and products transported by trucks?\n This sideways thing is a bit too logical for of the above commenters - ie \n- try don\u2019t like it when it\u2019s pointed out they do the same deeds \nthat they cry foul over. I expect some parallel universe logic to try and get \nthem out of any wrong doing, however. Lawrie replied to \nJack\n Tue 17 Jan 12 (01:46pm) \nAccording to US Wildlife Service \nhttp://www.fws.gov/birds/mortality-fact-sheet.pdf Most birds are killed flying \ninto windows. Cars kill far more than aeroplanes. Unfortunately the figures for \nvarious causes vary by up to 1000%. So it is all a bit of guesswork.\n In answer to your query you probably kill more with your car than Andrew \ndoes in a plane and don\u2019t foget that if the plane does kill a bird that \ndeath has to be shared by all the people on the plane. Also the plane and birds \nare only in close proximity for a short period of the flight whereas the \nturbines are in prime bird zones 24/7. squarepusher \nreplied to Jack\n Tue 17 Jan 12 (01:46pm) \nI dunno Jack, you tell us. \n Then perhaps you can tell us how that is even relevant to anything? \nWarrenTerra replied to Jack \n Tue 17 Jan 12 (02:00pm) \nNo doubt there will be follow up articles from Andrew detailing species \ndestruction from coal & nuclear fired power stations, airports, freeways, \ncar traffic in general, real estate development, military, dam building and on \nand on.

FB replied to Jack \n Tue 17 \nJan 12 (02:33pm) \nHey Jack - in case you\u2019ve missed the last few years, Bolt is not \nagainst flying, but apparently Bobbles is. And last I looked, 6 million birds a \nyear aren\u2019t been murdered by aeroplanes - they\u2019re being killed by \nthe Green-endorsed Climate Change chainsaw, ala wind turbines. What say you \nnow? Pathetic really. Echo replied to Jack \n Tue 17 \nJan 12 (02:43pm) \nYours is, but it surely is NOT logic!  DomS replied to \nJack\n Tue 17 Jan 12 (03:59pm) \nThe sideways logic is your own.

(Do or Die)\n\n\u00a0Home \n\nAn article from Do or Die Issue 8 . In the paper edition, this article \nappears on page(s)159-173 .\n Take a Sad Song and Make it Better? \n Ecological Restoration in the UK \n[IMAGE] Kennall Vale: Once the largest gunpowder factory in Cornwall. \n\"I see what is possible when we stand our ground, our common ground. I \nsee forests and grasslands filled with masses of flowers and the native birds \nand wildlife that had long ago disappeared from this part of the planet. I see \nwhat can be done from the barest beginnings and under the most impossible \nconditions, with hardly any means or resources. Not by calculating, or waiting \nfor the opportune moment, or the big money, or for a conference to confirm what \nmust be done. I see what can be done by the power of simply doing it. And as I \nturn toward the starkly contrasting landscape behind me, I see all that is yet \nto be done.\"(1)\nEcological restoration is one of the most compelling tasks that we face, if \nwe are to patch up the battered cradle of life that sustains us, as well as \nrenewing our own bruised mental ecologies. Successfully removing the sources of \nthe ongoing destruction will simply bring us round to our first full \nrealisation of the scale of capitalism's ecologically fractured legacy. The \nchallenge will be to steer ourselves to a gentle landing: not only the \nunglamorous work of clean-up, but the pre-eminent adventure of remaking an \nidyll from the wreckage. This unfolding process holds out the promise of a new \naccord: alienation banished, reconciled with ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOne obvious question is: why restore at all? Nature is resilient, with an \nimmense capacity for recovery, so long as natural processes are given \nsufficient space and time to operate freely. (Even in a hostile environment, \nlife still crowds irrepressibly up through the cracks.) History is littered \nwith stories of the detritus of past empires redeemed by the encroaching \nvegetation. Bill McKibben describes \"an explosion of green\" in the \nnorth-eastern US after farming was largely abandoned in the 19th century - in \nNew York State alone \"forest cover... continued to grow by more than a \nmillion acres a decade through 1980\".(2) Closer to home, \"thousands \nof acres of woodland sprang up on derelict land in south-east Essex in the \n1930s and 1940s\".(3)\nEnabling natural colonisation and regeneration, rather than the artifice of \nplanting, is widely favoured. This will \"allow the most appropriate \nspecies for each location and site to establish and in the long term will be \nmost likely to develop into healthy, biologically diverse woodland \necosystems\". (4) Conversely, the (understandable) \"human desire to \nsee instant results or at least appreciable results within our \nlifetime\"(5) risks contriving inferior, 'quick-fix' ersatz ecosystems - or \n'quite areas'.(6)\nThe desire to leave nature to its own regenerative devices is not just \nsound ecological sense, but a reasonable reaction to the depths of \nconservation's mania for management. After the Great Storm of 1987, one \norganisation blithely proclaimed that \"Trees are at great danger from \nnature\", and another that \"unless... positive encouragement [is] \ngiven to owners to restore these woods... they will revert to scrub and never \nrecover\".(7) Preposterous statements like \"it is important that \nwoodland is effectively managed to ensure its survival\"(8) seem to spring \nmore from an insecure need to feel wanted and indispensable - and thus engaging \nin frenetic busywork to obtain some kind of 'therapy through landscape'. \nConservationists often appear to suffer from a paternalist philosophy of 'spare \nthe saw and spoil the tree'.\nOthers have a valid objection to any energies devoted to restoration, given \nthe continuing onslaught against the vestiges of the natural that still remain \n- comparing it to \"repaint[ing] the kitchen cabinets when the house is on \nfire\".(9) Amongst practitioners however, there is a widespread assumption \nthat restoration is never a substitute for preservation - rather that the two \nshould complement one another, particularly in a country as devoid of healthy \necosystems as ours.(10) Developers, on the other hand, routinely abuse the \nconcept of restoration - and the related 'translocation'(11) - of habitats, as \na pretext smoothing the way for further destruction. Talk of 'planning gain', \n'end use', 'mitigation' and 'exchange land' is predicated on the spurious \nassumption that we can 'build a better habitat', as good as new - as if they \nwere just so many interchangeable parts on a Fordist assembly line. This kind \nof 'habitat engineering' is reminiscent of the environment industry's 'end of \npipe' approach to pollution, as applied to physical landscapes rather than \ntoxic chemicals: rejecting any inconvenient changes to their processes, instead \nconcentrating on lucrative 'cures' to treat the problems that invariably arise. \n(Don't forget that the Department of Transport (now DETR) is, laughably, the \nnation's biggest tree-planter.) Possibly one of the most repellent examples of \nthis is English Nature (the government's abysmal wildlife watchdog) allowing \npeat stripping scum Levington to take what it can from the fantastic Thorne and \nHatfield Moors SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), only to 'restore' \nthem in about 25 years' time.(12)\nHowever, the fact that nature can and does bounce back unaided should not \nbe cause for complacency. Recovery - particularly back to its original \ncondition - is not inevitable; nature can roll with most but not all of the \npunches we throw: \" 'Forests precede civilisation', it is said, 'deserts \nfollow'...The [Roman] Empire's North African breadbasket, where 600 cities once \nflourished, is now a desert, as are the forests that were the breeding grounds \nof Hannibal's elephants.\"(13) There is a place for human agency in the \nwork of restoration.\n[IMAGE] \nWhy Restore?\n\"Whether or not a devastated area recovers depends on a number of \nconditions. Most fundamentally, the site needs its original topsoil... if the \ntop horizon [of the soil] is altered - by adding chemicals, ploughing or \nplanting crops - a different kind of vegetation emerges when the site is \nabandoned... But if neither fertilisers nor crops are introduced, even heavily \nused areas can return to the condition of nearby undisturbed areas.\"(14) \nUnfortunately for us, since at least 1945, virtually all of lowland Britain \n(and much of the uplands) has been subjected to substantial soil \n'modification'. It may seem odd to define this as a problem, but huge tracts of \nour countryside are suffering from 'eutrophication', or excessive fertility - \neither as a result of direct application of chemicals, or indirectly felt on \nadjoining land through 'drift' of the chemicals. \"The intensity of the \nseed rain (from a once rich countryside) is much diminished, and though the \nseed bank in the soil may be long-lived for some species, decades of herbicide \nand inorganic fertiliser use have transformed soils to make a return to the \nprevious norm difficult without a helping hand\".(15)\nWhile natural regeneration may, in time, make good some of the losses, \nwithout any remedial intervention - including drastic measures such as actually \nstripping the topsoil(16) - we might find ourselves locked into an intractable \nspiral of decline. An example of this 'defertilising' work - perhaps better \ndescribed as rehabilitation than restoration - is the 'biomanipulation' \npractised on the Norfolk Broads to reduce accumulated phosphate pollution and \nthe accompanying algal blooms.(17) Such intervention has been described as a \n\"kickstart\" approach(18) - striving not to prejudice its future \ndirection, but setting nature back down on the launch pad, to go its own way.\n\nLooked at more broadly, our restoration efforts may at least help by \n\"undoing the constraints our industrialism have placed upon \n[nature]\".(19) For instance, while \"artificially straightened rivers \ntend to 'recover' naturally\"(20), this can't always be relied upon; \nextensive work was carried out on the Afon Ogwen (which \"resembled a land \ndrainage channel, not the Welsh river it once was\") in Snowdonia in 1998, \nbecause \"the natural... regime of the river had not shown any indication \nof being able to repair itself from the degradations\".(21) (See the \nprofile of the River Restoration Centre in the Restoration Roundup section, p. \n180) Rivers and their floodplains have fared as badly as the soil; there is a \npowerful case for reversing our ubiquitous drainage works, and reinstating \ncoherent hydrological regimes, in \"what must have been a gloriously wet \nnatural landscape\"(22) - as long as we can keep the ague (malaria) at bay \nthis time! (See RSPB Reedbed Creation profile in Restoration Roundup, p. 181.)\n\nThe scanty (semi) natural areas that we do still enjoy are in anything but \nrobust shape - ill-equipped to absorb the threats that future change and \nupheaval might bring. Much of conservation is dedicated to shoring up these \nwobbly, fragmented habitat islands - atomised, overcrowded life rafts, whose \nspecies are being inexorably worn down by 'biogeographical' attrition.(23) As \nthe National Trust's Rob Jarman explains, \"each unit of habitat lost \n[outside] makes the [ecological] communities on the Trust's properties that \nmuch more vulnerable to external change\".(24) 'An injury to all is an \ninjury to one' - for example, other 'reservoir' populations are less available \nto bail out local extinctions.(25) Probably the most critical challenge \nconfronting the fragments in their already weakened and susceptible state is \nthat of climate change(26) - or more correctly, the accelerated volatility of \nthe 'broken thermostat' effect.(27) As climate change brings the crisis of \nfragmentation to a head, now more than ever the agenda not only should be, but \nmust be one of \"restoration, enhancement and expansion... rather than just \ntrying to harm [the environment] less\"(28) - 'joining up the dots' to \nallow for migration in the face of rapidly changing conditions. It is not just \nthe physical movement of individuals and species that is at stake here, but \nopportunities for the exchange of unique, locally adapted genetic material, \nwhich have been so long constrained; basic genetic diversity is the ultimate \ninsurance policy against unpredictable change.(29)\nIn a country - like Britain - plagued with an advanced state of ecological \ndecomposition, what might be termed 'emergency ward' or 'basket case' \nconservation also becomes very important - this is, perhaps literally, \n'clutching at straws'. It can cover particular regions - eg. the Caledonian \npine forest of the Highlands (Glen Affric and Abernethy profiles in Restoration \nRoundup, p. 174 and 179), or the native woodlands of Orkney and Shetland \n(Orkney profile in Roundup, p. 184) - where the habitat is at such a perilously \nlow ebb that it is losing its grip on the cliff edge, and may not currently be \nable to 'help itself'. It can also encompass country-wide habitat types (and \nindeed species) whose near or total absence leaves a jarring gap in the \ncontinuum of the landscape. To pull a few names out of the hat, the following \nmight fall into this category: the natural transitions of woodland up to and \nbeyond the treeline (Carrifran Wildwood profile, p. 175), flooded or 'carr' \nforest (Gwen Finch Wetland Reserve profile, p. 176), lowland valley mires,(30) \nand so on.\nOne must not overlook the inward and social dimensions of ecological \nrestoration - they may even be its most crucial attributes. It is at the least \na statement of intent. Without getting too carried away with a sense of our \ncollective power, restoration is ripe with the liberating, even alchemical, \npromise of transformation - finding its material expression in our immediate \nsurroundings. It offers an exhilarating taste of that most dangerous commodity: \nhope, and a way out; there's everything to play for, all bets are off. As ever, \nwhen people are truly able to make their world - even the tiniest little scrap \n- the grinding malaise of destruction and loss begins to dissipate, prospects \nfor creation and renewal rebound, and imprisoning notions of 'human nature' go \nout the window. By getting to grips - down and dirty - with their common patch, \nso rarely permitted except under the auspices of government and industry, the \nbarren and hostile can become convivial space. We can begin to explore the \nlinks between conservation and conversation, between re-creation and \nrecreation. As the Mattole Restoration Council came to realise in Northern \nCalifornia, \"through engaging with the fundamental processes of a \nparticular place, we might discover the appropriate models for our own \nactivities and organisation\".(31) The restorer restored; the doing \n(praxis) is as important as the done (it's never 'done'). Tara Garnett writes \nof the 'emboldening' effect of, in this case, urban farming: it can \n\"stimulate a sense of common ownership and, in doing so, spur a sense of \ncommunity into existence. This community may then move on to further collective \naction\"(32)... During the riots in Benwell, Newcastle in the early 1990s, \nthe \"sense of ownership of the Park [which they had created] by the local \ncommunity became very apparent... Many houses and the local pub were burnt, but \nthe Nature Park - right in the centre - was untouched\".(33)\nThere is also an argument for efforts to maintain the rich, characteristic \ncultural - or 'vernacular' - landscapes, whose \"patterns in particular \nplaces were created locally by the daily work of ordinary people\".(34) \nWhile requiring potentially problematic 'management', they developed, at least \nin part, to satisfy local subsistence needs from local means, in the absence of \ntoday's national and global economy. In view of the pressing need to wean \nourselves off petrochemical dependence, and to avoid stomping our ecological \nfootprints across the globe(35), habitats like orchards, reedbeds, perhaps \ncoppice, etc., could have a lot to teach us. In conjunction with more recent \ntechniques such as permaculture, they could rejuvenate our sorely depleted \nskills base, and thus our own resilience and autonomy.(36)\nConservation and the Control Complex\nConservation has been described as \"a unique enterprise in which \nindustry expands as the resource diminishes, and there is no product\".(37) \nIn this respect it is a quintessentially 'post-modern' industry, and \nconservationists are masters of 'meta-work' (work about work) - ceaselessly \nnetworking and strategising within the 'charmed circle' of accredited bodies - \nand while \"ever more effort has gone into conservation of nature... ever \ngreater loss and destruction have occurred\".(38) When considered in \nhistorical context, the actual effect of most restoration efforts is only to \nreplace the lost with the new - imparting no 'net gain'. At best, depending on \nthe vagaries of the economy, it is a holding operation - managing the crisis, \nknife-edge stabilising of the rate of decline. By virtue of being \n'non-political' realists, conservationists are of course anything but. Refusing \nto wrestle with the explosive questions of power relations, land ownership and \ndistribution, they are forced to rely upon the fruitless \"voluntary \nprinciple\", and its 'unholy trinity' of incentives, policy and guidance - \nthe beseeching, red-carpet treatment for any landowner gracious enough to \nchange their ways.\nW.M. Adams argues that it is \"an anathema to many conservationists to \nconsider letting nature go\", and that \"caution about the abandonment \nof land is partly about the loss of control. Much of our conservation is based \nvery precisely on the idea of control\".(39) He likens it to \n\"gardening on a vast scale\"(40) - 'lawn order'. At times, \nconservationists seem far more forgiving of economic growth than scrub growth - \nlaissez faire for capitalism, zero tolerance for wild nature. (Maybe it is the \nonly thing over which they can exercise control in this society.) Wildness must \nbe quarantined(41) or taken into protective custody - kept in its place and \nmade, literally, 'manage-able'. The ferocity with which they fall upon scrub \nraises suspicions that it is a displacement activity - anything to divert \nattention from the uncomfortable realisation that 'You can't restore your way \nout of a social relationship.' Habitat loss has come primarily through social \nfactors, and can only truly be made good by social transformation - not by \nswimming against the tide with more acute and technically proficient land \nmanagement programmes.\nConservationists are incorrigible planners - partly through necessity, as \nfragmentation demands \"an ever more detailed and complex knowledge of the \nremaining [wildlife] interest\"(42) - and its corollary, an ever more \nspecialist and thus inaccessible conservation, reduced to a technical question. \nContinually sharpening management tools is not a bad thing in itself, but does \nseem part of the quest for the holy grail of the 'perfect plan', balancing \nevery conceivable need, at which point everything will fall neatly into place. \nAt worst, it smacks of the hubris of the technocrat, inhabiting an ordered, \npredictable and empirical universe - 'the tyranny of the measurable' - and a \nreluctance to admit to uncertainty and doubt - 'There are more things in heaven \nand earth than are dreamed of in your management plan'. Not being armed with a \nplan is to go naked and exposed into the wood.\nMarket values permeate the conservationist worldview: \"From economics \nhave come words and ideas such as 'producers', 'consumers' and 'efficiency', \nand using them ecologists have interpreted ecological change as working like a \nmodern industrial consumer society... [leaving] conservation with a strong \nlegacy of an instrumentalist view of nature... [and] nature as system\".(43)\n\nBut it's not quite this straightforward. Traditional ways of 'working' the \nland did at least enable some natural value to endure intact. Intensification \non the other hand has meant the disappearance of even the commonplace(44), and \na situation in which those areas which are 'zoned' for wildlife - like reserves \n- often have \"no natural environment left in between them\".(45) The \narchaic and unproductive \"1930s agriculture that conservationists \npractice\"(46) has become increasingly alienated from the rest of the \ncountryside. Hence there is a tension in conservation. On the one hand there is \nan impetus to detach land from (at least) the modern, intensive form of \neconomic circulation. Thus there is an implied critique of economic practices; \nboth because, on a practical level, conservationists are only too well aware of \nthe way in which they thwart and frustrate their best efforts, and \nphilosophically, because of a sense of nature as being, at heart, \nunassimilable: other than and perhaps diametrically opposed to the economy. On \nthe other hand, conservationists pursue a strategy of safeguarding and \njustifying ecological value by assigning economic value (the tail wagging the \ndog?): pricing, or 'enclosing', everything that moves (and some that doesn't) - \nrunning around with a butterfly net and a bar coder.(47) From this perspective \nthe problem is not the market itself, but those things that hang in valueless \nlimbo outside it. They must be reincorporated, if only by being enclosed within \na policy framework.\nAs well as being self-serving squealing for more snout-space in the \ngovernment trough, the following quote illustrates this well: \"Neglect is \na real issue, because the heathlands play no real role in any economic system \nand are simply not cared for. What is needed is better funding of conservation \nschemes which will enable owners and managers to produce the environmental \ngoods that society now demands.\" (48)\n[IMAGE] \nFarming for Wildlife, Farming of Wildlife\nThe crisis now afflicting farming is the spectre haunting conservation. \nTheir banal big idea, in response to the looming problems triggered by \noverproduction, liberalisation of world trade under the GATT Treaty and so on, \nis to reform the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Apparently our basic \nstructures are sound, it is just the details that need 'tweaking' or \nfine-tuning - 'this is a job for the policy wonks'! (Some are even still \nresorting to an 'unfettered' free market - as opposed to the 'distortions' of \nthe CAP - as the answer to all our woes.[49]) CAP subsidies will be redirected \ntowards 'agri-environment' grants, the panacea which will help to reposition \nfarming, and enable farmers to 'diversify'. Agriculture's new identity will \nprimarily be as purveyor of intangible luxury \"environmental goods\", \nsuch as delivering 'biodiversity targets' - 'farming for wildlife' - the food \nsurplus presenting us with \"a tremendous window of opportunity for \nredesigning the countryside for other purposes\":(50) in theory, making \ngood those habitat losses. As the Council for National Parks say, \"the \nmain product is a wild and sustainable landscape, not stock or \ntimber.\"(51) (Whether any of this is 'sustainable' is open to question - \nit hinges upon the continuation of surplus, and a highly sophisticated economy \nthat is able to forego economic return on land and 'set it aside'.)\nAccording to Raoul Vaneigem, \"so brutal has the exploitation of nature \nbeen that its resources - the very nature of its profitability - are threatened \nwith exhaustion; there is thus no choice but to develop ecological markets in \norder to get the economy out of its present morass.\"(52) Central to this \nis the task of devising 'virtuous products', along with 'virtuous jobs' like \nconservation - zealous self-alienation - working long hours for low pay, 'for \nthe cause'.\n'Farming for wildlife' readily becomes 'farming of wildlife': its discrete \ncommodification (and heaven help those uncharismatic species that are left out \nin the cold, that can't be commodified[53]). For example, Landlife (see their \nprofile in the Roundup) are administering the \"Market Gardening with \nIndigenous Species\" project, under which \"local farmers will be \nplanting wildflower crops [sic] thanks to a grant from the European \nAgricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund\".(54) (By the way, their National \nWildflower Centre's mission is to promote \"the creation of new habitats \nthat have economic, environmental and ecological benefits for the \nnation.\"[55])\nMany nature reserves already seem akin to 'beauty factories', governed by \n'aesthetic productivism'. What are sometimes known as \"physical \noutputs\" are maximised; one manager, discussing the merits of \nnon-intervention, bemoaned the fact that \"funders [of reserves]... want to \nsee action and colour\" - hence coppicing, which \"bring[s] about a \nshort burst of bluebells and butterflies\"(56) - 'all fluttering, all \nflowering' habitats, practically on performance-related pay. Nature is \n\"consumed in special places... and made to yield predictable \nproducts\", becoming \"one among a range of commodities that can be \npurchased by the wealthy to enhance their leisure time.\"(57)\n'Reserve cramming' (like 'town cramming') - or 'high unit productivity' - \nis partly a consequence of fragmentation. For instance, \"woods often act \nas reserves for the whole landscape, especially in intensively arable regions. \nMany... should be regarded as grassland reserves, as well as woodland \nreserves\".(58) They must work flat out to be all things to all taxa - to \n'please all of the species all of the time'. But \"the more effort that is \nput in to make it rich, the further it departs from naturalness\".(59)\nWith restoration there is also the temerity of 'zoning for wildlife' - \nstriding grandly about the landscape, prescribing 'here a hay meadow, there a \nsalt marsh' (but not there) - or 'this is a wood for butterflies, that one is \nfor lichens' (a kind of 'comparative advantage' - hopefully with 'trickle down \neffect' benefits for other species.)\nReading RSPB(60) reports I am mesmerised by the dance of the graphs. \nConservation is reminiscent of an EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale) stock-taking \nsystem, monitoring a steady stream of population data - eg. such-and-such has \njust made it into the Red Data Book (the species emergency list) - their stock \nis low - 'Darren, we need more garganey'. The habitat creation trucks then get \nrolling for this 'just in time' production, bringing new waders on line to \nmatch identified need.\nRestoration and management for wildlife might actually have detrimental \nindirect effects on the surrounding area. 'Rewetting' of depleted wetland \nreserves may exacerbate the serious problem of water abstraction: it can cause \nthe already degraded neighbouring countryside to become even drier and less \nhospitable, by creaming off what little surplus water there is.(61) These \nrefugia might therefore consolidate habitat fragmentation, monopolising the \nwildlife, acting like a vortex which strips its hinterland of biodiversity, or \nlike an out of town supermarket, emptying value out of its vicinity. For \nexample, Pulborough Brooks in Sussex's Arun valley (see profile in the Roundup) \nnow harbours \"up to 75% of the total Arun valley wintering birds\" \nevery January. (62) While \"bird counts on the reserve are soaring... \ncounts for the area are still falling disastrously.\"(63) By concentrating \nthe 'resource' like this, the very visible spectacular displays at Pulborough \nmay be masking the decline rather than reversing it. (Although it seems likely \nthat in the long run the whole of the Arun valley may actually benefit from \nPulborough.)\nIn an era when the dollar is being encoded into DNA - the final, molecular, \nfrontier of enclosure - the question 'what is nature?' is no longer just a \nmatter for dry philosophical discourse.(64) David Helton reported on the 1992 \nmeeting of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), \nwhere the doctrine of 'sustainable utilisation' - and by extension, the \nquestion of nature's 'identity' - was up for grabs. Like 'farming for \nwildlife', it involves a species being \"taken out of the economics of \nnature and brought into the economics of man [sic]\"(65) and is heralded as \n\"some kind of solution to the problems of human growth, both numeric and \neconomic, without that growth having to stop\". The rhino is \"the one \nlarge mammal in the world whose existence is conspicuously threatened by \ninternational trade\", and has therefore been purposefully excluded from \nthe economic sphere by CITES. And yet, the proposal in 1992 was still to \nactually \"harvest\"' horn from live rhinos and \"put [it]... on \nthe legalised, reopened market\", with the result that \"rhinos would \nbe paying their own way in the world.\"\nThankfully the proposal was rejected, but as Helton observes, the future \nforeshadowed by this approach \"doesn't look like one worth living in, for \npeople or rhinos either. The reason we save the rhino... is because it's... \nliving wild on its own terms and deserving to. If we have to use emergency \nmeasures now... it's only so that some time in the future rhinos can return to \ntheir proper existence, in a world made sane again, with humanity under its own \ncontrol and for the other species a normal wild life, not as livestock in a \nglobal barnyard - not with the rhino as some kind of tonic-producing cow, an \nongoing business. It would almost be better off extinct.\" It's a clearcut \nchoice, albeit one that has been foisted upon us: to \"either stop growing \nor go for a desperate long shot and put absolutely everything under human \nmanagement\".(666)\n[IMAGE] \nDisturbing Climaxes\nNatural succession is the \"process of change in plant communities over \ntime towards a natural climax, for example from grassland to scrub and then \nwoodland.\"(67) Conservationists have been fighting the 'wars of \nsuccession' since at least the 1960s, in an attempt to retain those wildlife \nvalues that flow from continuity of traditional management features such as \nheathland. (It should be pointed out here that it can be very difficult to \nprecisely define the 'traditional practices' that conservation harks back \nto.(68) Also, that arresting ecosystem change in this way has been pointedly \ncompared to the futility of \"trying to hold back a flood with a \nraincoat.\"[69]) However, conservationists are now beginning to stage what \nmight be called a 'managed retreat' (a la Dunkirk?) from universally regulating \nsuch natural processes - perhaps 'learning to let go'.\nThe orthodox model of nature emphasised predictability and continuity. \nChange did figure in the equation, but only as part of an orderly and \ninexorable progression, with each stage in the succession obligingly laying \ndown the conditions for the next, until it achieved a stable equilibrium - a \nrelatively 'steady-state' (revealing term![70]) climax vegetation like \nwoodland(71). This is of course at least in part a cultural construct, \nreflecting the political climate out of which it sprang as much as it does \nnature. The theory \"was strongly rooted in Darwinian ideas of biological \nevolution, and spin-off ideas of social 'progress' \";(72) redolent of a \ntime of 'eternal verities', a naturally ordained and fixed social order and a \nlinear and cumulative conception of history. Humanity was perched in its \nrightful place atop the evolutionary tree - the 'Crown of Creation', or 'climax \nspecies' - with the imputed hierarchy in nature serving to endorse the ranking \nof classes and races within humanity itself.\nHowever, we now find that \"climax, like the horizon, may be a useful \nconcept, but it... can never be reached... when ecologists examined climax \nvegetation their studies were upset by disturbance. It soon became clear that \ndisturbance was not an exception, a temporary upset, but a central part of the \necology of a habitat.\"(73) Disturbance, from grazing, windblow, fire, \nflooding, erosion and a host of other factors, is perpetually disrupting \n\"the progression towards theoretical climax\",(74) resetting the clock \nback. In a sense, 'there is no beginning and there is no end' - it's all \nprocess - an open-ended question. It has been pointed out that people respond \nto events rather than processes - particularly in spectacular society, where \nsocial phenomena are prised loose from their context and reproduced as \ndisembodied and mystifying 'events'. (Conversely, ecology is, if nothing else, \nthe story of context - the antithesis of spectacular amnesia.) Looked at in \nthis light, nature reserves - managed as frozen moments in ecological time - \nrepresent soundbite or 'event' habitats.\nThis new-found taste for disturbance and uncertainty has led ecologists \naway from \"nature as a well-behaved deterministic system\"(75) towards \n\"instability, disorder, a shifting world of upheaval and change that has \nno direction to it\"(76) (Mao's 'permanent revolution', perhaps?!) Since \n\"autonomy is [now] viewed as a fundamental characteristic of 'real' \nnature\", it tends to operate as more of \"a game than a controllable \nsystem\".(77) This suggests possibilities of a more gratifying, 'sensuous' \ncharacter to humanity's interactions with nature - as a 'player within the \ngame', not an engineering outsider - whose role might be to \"conserve the \ncapacity of nature to re-create itself\".(78)\nDisturbance is the engine of ecological variety in the landscape, \npreventing those species that would dominate under (eg.) a closed canopy climax \nhaving it all their own way. There is what might be called a 'dialectic' \nbetween structure (such as the canopy) and disturbance here: \"Too little \ndisturbance leads to dominance of a few strong competitors, while a heavy \ndisturbance regime [as in most of Britain] is tolerated only by a few hardy \nspecies.\"(79) Our best bet could be the supremely difficult practice of \nfaithfully emulating the effects of natural disturbance - the conundrum of \n'planning for chance'. We've already been unknowingly engaged in a form of this \nfor centuries: \"As the original wildwood became cleared and fragmented, \ndisturbance from management gradually took over from natural disturbance... \nwhich can not operate on the small scale\". However, this supplanting of \nnatural processes by management represents a coarsening and simplification - \nonly \"some of the attributes of natural disturbance [have] \ncontinued\"(80) - the effects of our management have been too uniform, and \nsome crucial components have fallen by the wayside.\nWhat Are We Missing?\n\"The ecological effect of most woodland management is to artificially \nremove the late mature and decaying elements of the regeneration \ncycle\",(81) including the dead wood \"which accounts for 50% of the \ntimber in old forest\",(82) and is \"one of the two or three greatest \nresources of the woodland habitat\".(83) Without this, we miss out on the \n\"healthy fungal flora [which] contributes significantly to the ecological \nhealth of the wood\"(84), by breaking the dead wood down and making its \nnutrients available to other plants. As Hambler and Speight point out, a \nwhopping \"70% of the energy flow through a terrestrial ecosystem is \nthrough the decomposer community\",(85) including fungi. In our woodlands, \nthis flow is blocked.\nAnother vital element is one that many of us only saw for the first time \nafter the 1987 storm: the \"pit and mound\" topography formed by the \nupended root plates of toppled trees, which can cover \"14 - 50% of the \nforest floor in some unmanaged American woods\".(86) Ordinarily, rain \nleaches nutrients away from an undisturbed soil's surface. The upturned trees \ninstead turn and mix the soil, bringing nutrients back up to the surface and \nencouraging plant germination - acting as \"an added degree of soil \nrejuvenation\".\nAccording to Tony Whitbread, \"woodland soils would not naturally form, \nlayer on layer, without... [such] mixing.\"(87) Deprived of such intrinsic \nfeatures as these, who can now imagine the ensuing richness and vibrancy that \nour countryside lacks?\nFinally, there are the \"ecotones\" - 'twilight zones' where a \npalette of habitats melt seamlessly into and out of one another, in a kind of \nhybridising. \"Many species rely on [this] interface between one habitat \nand another\",(88) but not only do roads, intensive farming, etc, dismember \nthis delicate habitat continuum, fluid \"change is often prevented by \nmanagement\"(89) as well. For example, \"there may be a sharp boundary \nbetween a wood and a hay meadow. Scrub invasion, left unchecked, would soon \noverwhelm the meadow, but the regime that resists it eliminates the ecotone \ninstead. Such harsh zonation is often the only way to preserve habitat \nfragments, but leaves no room for natural processes to operate.\"(90) It is \ndifficult to manage for ecotones(91), emblematic as they are of a dynamic, \nsupple 'landscape of flux' - which leaves us with a straight choice between \n'zoning' and 'process'. Zoning causes the pattern of habitats to ossify, in a \nkind of 'habitat reductionism'.\nWork, and other 'socially polluting' alienated activities, can be seen as a \n'habitat fragmentation' of the time of our lives; with 'management' leading to \nzoning - artificial disjunctions - and eliminating soft-edged ecotones. As \nAndre Gorz says, \"The way our space is arranged carries on the \ndisintegration of people that begins with the division of labour in the \nfactory. It cuts a person into slices, it cuts our time, our life, into \nseparate slices.\"(92) If you don't believe me, think about how your lunch \nhour feels (assuming you are still allowed one), or the slow, ominous countdown \nof a Sunday night.\nThe National Forest and the Community Forests - Managing People and Nature\n\n[IMAGE] Community Forests: 'screening industry' \nThe National Forest, the twelve Community Forests, and the activities of \nthe Groundwork organisation (see Wren's Nest Estate profile in \n\"Restoration Roundup\") are all examples of a 'restoration' which is \nas much concerned with the management of people as it is of nature. The \nNational Forest, which aims to create a \"multi-purpose forest\"(93) \nover 200 square miles of the Midlands, sees itself as \"a model of \n'sustainable development'\".(94) The Community Forests are situated on the \nurban fringe of major English towns, subscribe to the same multi-function \nforestry framework, and constitute, allegedly, \"the most significant \nenvironmental programme to be launched in Britain this century\".(95) \nPretty much as you'd expect, they are therefore crap. Both kinds of 'forest' \nhave the superficially laudable goal of increasing Britain's pathetic average \ntree cover of 7% to around 30% in their area. However, 'multi-purpose forestry' \nis such that one of them actually thought it necessary to remind itself that \n\"Trees will play a vitally important role in achieving the community \nforest\".(96)\nSo puny are most of their new woodlands that they deserve to be known as \n\"fun-sized\" woods - in honour of the unsatisfying and 'anything but' \nMars Bar of the same name.(97) It seems to be a case of drawing lines on a map \nand designating 'publicity' or 'policy forests', composed of 'enterprise \nglades'(98), the modern day bureaucrat's equivalent of the treeless 'Deer \nForests' of Scottish feudalism. (There's no shortage of (bureaucratic) deadwood \nin these forests.) Since the objective is to \"improve the image\"(99), \none gets the impression that they would be as content with just the \"early \nimpression of forest cover\"(99) as with the real McCoy - so long as things \nare seen to be done.\nThe true agenda of Groundwork and the various forests is one of \n'regeneration' and 'reclamation'. By and large they are superimposed on the \nformer strongholds of heavy industry in the Midlands and the North - those \nareas most badly abused by and then, in the 1980s, abandoned by capitalism. It \nis about \"managing change\"(100) - using trees as a device to bring \nunsightly 'derelict land' back into economic circulation, and addressing \nagricultural overproduction through farm 'diversification' into forestry and \nleisure. It is about trying to ensure a smooth transition to the post-modern \n'service' or 'information' economy, where the intangible environmental goods \nand 'quality of life' issues are paramount - eg. as at the new \"Earth \nCentre\", near Doncaster.(101) In the National Forest, \"this \nregenerated coalfield land, which provided the local community with jobs in the \npast, will serve them in other ways in the future by providing recreational \nfacilities, wildlife habitats and an attractive landscape.\"(102) It is \nabout tailoring a flexible, 'multi-tasking' landscape for a flexible economy - \nthe (relative) solidarity of the old heavy industries giving way to the \n(relative) atomisation of the casual, service sector - where, doubtless, we'll \nall work in \"partnership\".\nThe Red Rose Forest (Manchester) claim, in a particularly howling \nnon-sequitur, that \"economic, environmental and social regeneration cannot \nproceed without one another\".(103) Providing \"an attractive \nenvironment in which business can flourish\"(104) is the Forests' main \nweapon in the mad, begging-bowl scramble to attract inward investment, giving \nthem \"a competitive advantage over competitor areas\" (105) - a \npitiful 'Pretty please' to developers. Because, more than anything else, \n\"this forest means business\",(106) if all goes according to plan \nthese 'forests' might actually end up more heavily developed than before: \n\"where... [planning] policies allow for increased industrial development, \na high quality landscape can be a valuable first step in an area's \nrevitalisation [sic].\"(107) As well as having their office premises or \nsurplus sites tarted up - what the Mersey Forest calls \"screen[ing] \nindustry\",(108) or landscaping as physical PR - usually at public expense, \nit offers another more subtle service to business. This is the 'philanthropic \nadvantage' that comes when you \"display your environmental \ncredentials\", helping to \"generate goodwill... [and] raise... product \nand brand awareness\".(109) Thus we have Manchester Airport supporting a \ntrifling new tree planting programme - mulched with 'bioregional' Bollin Valley \nwoodchips, no doubt - through the 'Manchester Aviation Tree Challenge', and \nsanctimonious noises about the \"important part [that trees play] in \nreducing greenhouse gases and global warming.\"(110)\nNor have the older, more classically industrial uses entirely gone away. \nGrotesque 'planning gain' and 'end use' scams are rife: \"Mining will \ncontinue to be a major activity within the Forest... The case for [minerals] \ndevelopment is certainly strengthened if the developer can show a benefit to \nthe National Forest.\"(111) At Broxtowe in the Greenwood Community Forest \n(Nottinghamshire), \"opencast mining operations\" will, in the \ntopsy-turvey world these people inhabit, \"ultimately [bring]... about \neconomic and environmental benefits\": a new woodland of 14 hectares which \nwill \"provide an attractive backdrop\" for a \"new employment site \nof 8 hectares\".(112) (This is presumably the kind of thing they have in \nmind when they talk of - in Groundwork's words - \"integrating the economy \nand the environment\".[113])\n[IMAGE] \n'Community', 'Partnership' and All That Jazz\nAll of this - particularly in the case of Groundwork - comes robotically \ndecked out in odious communitarian jargon, such as 'stakeholding', 'capacity \nbuilding', 'zero tolerance' (controlling 'anti-social behaviour' through \nenvironmental design[114]), 'participation' and 'partnership'. It is consistent \nwith Blairite 'big tent' politics - subsuming most potential opponents and \nmarginalising those that won't be co-opted.(115) The insidious weed of \n'partnership', with its smothering, spurious consensus (like being 'love \nbombed'), seems to be springing up everywhere nowadays. 'Partnership' \nmendaciously supposes that we all come to the table as equals, and, \nconveniently, that we all bear a shared responsibility for what has gone wrong \n- nasty, disruptive blame and dissension must not intrude on these mature \ndeliberations. Class and other power differentials are submerged in the bland, \nostensibly classless interest in 'saving the planet' (a 'union sacree') - \npolitical questions are reframed as dispassionate technical ones - the quest \nfor the 'perfect plan' again. It's just a new way - their latest wheeze - for \nus to get screwed. \"The cleverly constructed notion of \"sustainable \ndevelopment\" with its emphasis on harmonious consensus in decision-making, \ncombined with the incorporation of the environment into the market system, has \ndissipated the imperative that environmental deterioration once had for social \nand political change.\"(116)\n\"Community\" - partnership's medium - seems to be the elusive \nPhilosopher's Stone of '90s politics; the supreme value before which - \nirrespective of political persuasion - we must all prostrate ourselves. \n(Interestingly, the term is most commonly used either where it patently does \nnot exist - eg. 'the business...', 'international', the rural 'community' of \nthe Countryside March - or where it is in some way threatened or in question - \neg. 'the black...', 'the gay...')\nGroundwork constantly brag of their presence in depressed, 'no go' areas - \nthere is more than a hint of the 'community development' troops being \nparachuted in: \"Throughout the western world states are characterised by \none of the two symbols of control in capitalist society: the tank or the \ncommunity worker\".(117) The 'environmental' focus of the work also serves \nto locate the community's problems squarely within its own physical fabric, \nrather than as emanating from wider, structural forces - as if by simply \nbeautifying the area, you will 'beautify' the social relationships that people \nexperience.\nThe 'partnership' and 'participation' must only extend so far. The \ncommunities must not realise too uppity a sense of their own strength - which \nis to say, truly become a community - or the development workers and their \npolitical masters might become expendable. In the same way that capitalism, \nfrom the 1920s on, had to \"simultaneously... encourage and repress the \n'creation of dissatisfaction' ''(118) if it was to shift its surplus goods, \nthis 'community development' must simultaneously unleash and rein in \nempowerment. Like derelict land, 'derelict' communities are brought back into \neconomic circulation, and their members enlisted in 'gilding their cage'. \nForget building the Situationists' hacienda, mate - you don't want to do it \nlike that - this is building the 'strategic hamlet'.\nLocal communities are deployed as proxies - a cost-effective means of \ndelivering the desired results.(119) In a hidden subsidy to industry, we do the \ndirty work of clearing up the 'externalities' they leave behind. \"Working \nin partnership with local authorities and businesses, Community Forests harness \nthe commitment and enthusiasm of local people, mobilising them to regenerate \ntheir area\".(120) (Oooh, it sounds so good since you put it like that.) \nPaul Goon (appropriately) of the government's 'English Partnerships' \ncongratulates Groundwork on \"their unrivalled ability to co-ordinate local \ncommunities, engender enthusiasm and deliver the goods at excellent value for \nmoney.\"(121) It echoes Paulette Goudge's comment on Third World aid, that \n\" 'sustainable development' no longer refers to preserving the \nenvironment; it now means developments that communities can financially sustain \nthemselves\"(122) - the 'polluted pays' principle.\nIn contrast to the economy's 'flexible landscape', in which we are obliged \nto accept the loss of cherished features, as decreed, 'heritage' is constructed \nas a reassuring beacon of stability - 'that which is forever England'. There is \na tension between the frequent appeals to such sentiments of a 'common' \nheritage' ('our' patch), and otherwise jealously guarded property rights. It \nonly becomes 'ours' when it suits them - we only get to inherit their cast off \ndregs, and must be suitably grateful when granted that much. (Many of the \nGroundwork and Community Forest sites are, for instance, former chemical waste \ndumps and landfills.) Perhaps the residents of the Amazon will one day be \nexhorted to restore 'their' forest, when it has finally been logged out for \ntremendous private gain. 'Bottom up' is employed to correct the miserable \nfailures of 'top down'. However they choose to label the bottle it always \ntastes like shit - instead, we must choose 'praxis' over 'proxy'.\nAccording to Ulrich Beck, the ecological movement is not so much \"an \nenvironmental movement but a social, inward movement which utilises 'nature' as \na parameter for certain questions.\"(123) While one can quibble with his \ndistinction between the \"environmental\" and the \"social\", \nbasically there's a lot of truth to this view. Perhaps the major revolutionary \ncontribution of environmentalism (in the broadest possible sense) is in \nexploring issues of control over space, the ways in which its use is currently \ndetermined, and the ways in which those uses can be radically transformed. \nThese questions may have assumed a greater relative importance in recent years, \ngiven the seeming decline of the power to organise and act in the workplace. \nLike \"the Street Party of street parties\",(124) our very first need, \n(the one which prefigures and makes possible the rediscovery of all our myriad \nother needs), is for \"a place in which people [can] gather - a common \nground - and focus their attentions on things that could improve the quality of \ntheir general existence, and that of wildlife\".(125) The act - of \noccupying a place and remaking it as a space used for interaction and renewal - \nis an answer to many of our questions in itself. Restoration can be harnessed \nto make the world safe for capital - by replenishing the regions whose \nprofitability it has exhausted - or can create something which is inimical to \nit: headstrong communities savouring their own innate resourcefulness. When \nasked how people might spend their time after the revolution, Marcuse replied \nthat \"We will tear down the big cities and build new ones\"(126) - \nwhose \"districts... could correspond to the whole spectrum of diverse \nfeelings that one encounters by chance in everyday life\",(127) \nmultifarious nefarious space in which hitherto unrequited lives and blighted \npotential might at last find expression, freed from the monocultural dictates \nof capital. We are a very long way from that now, but wherever we see \"the \nrestoration of whole ecosystems and the empowerment of communities \ntogether\",(128) its allure beckons, and we are another step closer.\n[IMAGE] The only half-decent thing to come out of the horrific M3 extension \nthrough Twyford Down was the ripping up, re-contouring and grassing over of the \nold A33 Winchester bypass. It gave the people of Winchester easy access across \nthe flood meadows of the River Itchen to St. Catherine's Hill for the first \ntime in decades. A mere 5 years after the work was done, however, and the local \ncouncil already wants to re-tarmac 20 acres of the site as a park-and-ride \nfacility. There is strong local opposition to being robbed of their precious \ngreen space once more.\nFootnotes\n\n\"Revisiting Auroville\", Alan Lithman, in \"Helping Nature \nHeal: An Introduction to Environmental Restoration,\" Ed.

Zamora looks for dead birds and bats that have been \nsevered by the spinning blades of the surrounding wind turbines in order to \nconduct survey's to observe how\u00a0wind-power development\u00a0is affecting \nbirds.\u00a0\n\"It's like a crime scene, and you try to figure out what \nhappened,\" said Zamora. \"Sometimes it's really obvious because you \ncan see a slice mark.\"\nThese surveys are financed by the wind industry and are mainly concerned \nwith birds like eagles, hawks, and other\u00a0raptors. Klickitat County is \nespecially a concern because the area has an abundance of prey for these larger \nbirds, hence, they tend to stay in the area. According to the study, these \nbirds are diving for their prey and do not pay attention to the large wind \nturbine blades that may be in the way.\n There are differing views between scientists, biologists and wind-energy \ndevelopers as to whether birds are at high risk because no one knows what \ncumulative death toll will have a significant impact on the species.\u00a0\nWind-power advocates say \"these deaths are an acceptable trade-off for \ndevelopment of a renewable energy source.\" They also note that man-made \nhazards and house cats account for tens of millions of\u00a0bird-related deaths\n\u00a0per year.\u00a0According to Mike Sagrillo, a consultant who writes for \nthe American Wind Energy Association, bird mortality \"at wind farms, \ncompared to other human-related causes of bird mortality, is biologically and \nstatistically insignificant.\"\n The surveys taken in Klickitat County showed that wind power is only a \nminor hazard to birds, but scientists say it's too early to really \n\"discount the risks posed by the rush to develop Northwest wind \npower.\"\nA survey in Klickitat County at the\u00a0Big Horn Wind Farm\u00a0indicated \nthat more than 30 raptors were killed \"during an initial year of \noperations - more than seven times the number forecast in a pre-construction \nstudy.\" Among the dead birds were short-eared owls, kestrels, red-tailed \nhawks and a ferruginous hawk.\u00a0\n \"We take questions and concerns of wildlife impacts very \nseriously,\" said Jan Johnson, a spokeswoman for Iberdrola Renewables, \nwhich owns the Big Horn Wind Farm.\u00a0\nIn addition to these findings,\u00a0Altamount Pass Wind Farms\u00a0in \nCalifornia have older wind turbines from the 1980's that have killed more \nraptors \"per megawatt of power than anywhere else in the nation.\" \nThese wind farms kill more than 1,600 raptors per year.\n While developers have agreed to relocate turbines away from canyon ridges \nwhere the large birds of prey spend most of their time, the death toll is still \nexpected to rise due to the lack of information regarding what death toll is \nbiologically significant to these birds.\u00a0\nA study by West, Inc.\u00a0that was paid for by the Klickitat County \nPlanning Department showed that the\u00a0turbines would kill\u00a0516 raptors \neach year just in the Columbia River plateau region of Oregon and Washington if \nthe industry doubled in size. The study determined that this was not a \nsignificant number, but ecologist K. Shawn Smallwood thinks the study \nunderestimates the number of deaths and that it's hard to conclude whether \nthese wind turbine-related deaths would harm an entire species. \n\n \nComments  \u00a0 \u00a0 Threshold -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 \n\n\n\nUsername \n\nPassword \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 remember me \n\n\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n \n(5 Hidden) \nWhat are the chances By omnicronx on 6/7/10, \nRating:4 \nBy omnicronx on 6/7/2010 12:09:55 PM , Rating: \n4 \nThat giant spinning blades are killing birds and animals \npassing through them?\n\nI'm going to have to see the findings of this \nstudy as I just don't believe it to be true!.. \n\n\n\n\n\n (5 Hidden) \nRE: What are the chances By omnicronx on 6/7/10, \nRating:3 \nBy omnicronx on 6/7/2010 12:11:11 PM , Rating: \n3 \nand I would just like to know..\n\nHow many birds do you \nthink die a year as a result of a single high rise building with reflective \nwindows?

It is obvious a bird caused it, \nand I'm sure they cause this all across America in many homes.\n\nThese \nWind Farms are not a problem at all, the environmentalists just aren't looking \nat it properly. With all the talk of unemployment in America, lack of proper \nhealthcare and lackluster jobs growth, these people need to re-assess their \nstudies. Wind Farms are providing many benefits that clearly can be seen if you \nlook a little further into it:\n\n1.  America eats birds program:  People \nnear these farms are STARVING! Not only do they need affordable power, they \nalso need food! Dead birds=food... for cheap! They already have paid their \npower bills, now they get discounted birds in their supermarkets (or, they \ncould drive up and participate in an \"America eats birds\" program.\n2.  Scrounging hour:  This will also help the wind farms cut costs by \nallowing the people to come onto the lots on \"scrounging hour\" to \npick the best of the bunch to fill their bellies.\n\n3.  \nCash-For-Feathers program: Look, shelter capacity is at an all time demand \nlately and we just can't afford to open any more of them. These birds have a \nlucrative byproduct other than their organ meat. They have feathers! If you \nallow Americans to trade-in their feathers (after they eat the rest of the \nbird) in the \"Cash-For-Feathers\" program, our Government can then use \nthese feathers to fill pillows and mattresses in shelters across the country.\n\nI feel horrible for all those that are impoverished these days and \nthis is the least our government can do to capitalize on this untapped resource.\n\n4.  Stylin' for America:  In this program, citizens can turn in the \nbeaks of the birds they eat in to our Government so it can subsidize Shampoo \nand Skin-Care products for everyone! Keratin is vital for revitalizing our \nbeauty. Now there will be no excuse at all for Americans not looking their best.\n\nAnd most importantly,\n\n5.  Hot Dogs n' Ballparks for kids:  \nWhen our economy is down, more Americans should be watching Baseball, our \nnational pasttime (who knew?!). With the advent of inflated ticket prices due \nto athletes being paid absurd amounts of money (they work really hard!), it has \nbecome grossly harder for the average family to afford the essentials of a good \ngame: peanuts and hot dogs.\n\nWell, we can fix that, America! With the \nHot Dogs n' Ballparks program, all Americans who consume birds from these \nWindfarms can use a Government\u2122 Nitrate Rectal Extration Kit\u2122 to \npull valuable nitrates straight from the dead birds and send it in to \ndramatically reduce Hot Dog processing costs! This will lower expenses at \nballparks around our great country and help fill the stands, letting us forget \nabout the hard times that are upon us. People from afar can come 'sportin their \nnew do's and bring their Government\u2122 stuffed cushions to sit on.\n\n\nSo, what did we learn here, kids? Think! That's right environmentalists, this \nis an opportunity!

The reason is simple, you can't sustain something that \nis not sustainable. :)\n\nMy electric bill, from where I come from, has \nthe following information about the sources of the energy:\n\nEolic: 33,0%\nHydro: 24,8%\nCo-generation and Micro-production 14,0% (home solar \npanels)\nNatural Gas: 9,3%\nNuclear: 7%\nHydro PRE: 8,2% (can't \ntranslate)\nOther: 4,1%\nCoal: 1,9%\n\nI would say 33% eolic is \npretty impressive.\n\nThe main problem with eolic power isn't even its \ncost. The problem is that it does not reduce the peek output required from \nother sources because there are moments where there is no wind. You can build \nall the wind farms you want, you'll still need the backing nuclear, coal or \nwhatever plants.\n\nDiscussing about how many birds does a wind turbine \nkill is just stupid. You need to back up and look at the big picture. No matter \nwhat we decide to do to get power it's going to leave a footprint, it's more a \nquestion of how big do you want the footprint to be. \n\n\nParent \n \n\n(1 Hidden) \nRE: dont forget By clovell on 6/7/10, \nRating:2 \nBy clovell on 6/7/2010 3:22:38 PM , Rating: \n2 \nYes, and to understand that, sometimes you need to consider how \nmany birds is this gonna kill if I raise the number of wind turbines ten-fold. \n \n\nParent \n\n\n\n\nRE: dont forget By omnicronx on \n6/7/10, Rating: 2 \nBy omnicronx on 6/7/2010 4:53:11 PM , \nRating: 2 \nBy the same account, how many birds could this \nsave by getting away from a traditional energy sources? Figuring out how many \nmore birds will die is completely irrelevant if it is not weighed it against \nhow we currently get our energy.\n\nFor example, even right now it is \nestimated that 10-40K birds die from wind turbines. Now lets for a minute \nassume that number is on the low and give it say 50k per year.\n\nNow \nlets compare that against say, the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 which killed \nan estimated 250K birds in a few days. Even if you were to increase capacity by \nfive, it would only equal the impact of 1 large oil spill.\n\nAnd as \nnoted in my other post, regardless of energy source, power lines remain one of \nthe leading causes for bird deaths worldwide.(including birds of prey like \nthose being mentioned in the article) We are talking exponentially larger, as \nin 3000x+ more than current Wind Turbine deaths per year. \n\n\nParent \n \n\n\n(3 Hidden) \nRE: dont forget By MozeeToby on 6/7/10, \nRating: 2 \nBy MozeeToby on 6/7/2010 1:09:14 PM , \nRating:2 \nI've never understood people that think they're ugly. \nPersonally, I find them to be elegant and attractive.
