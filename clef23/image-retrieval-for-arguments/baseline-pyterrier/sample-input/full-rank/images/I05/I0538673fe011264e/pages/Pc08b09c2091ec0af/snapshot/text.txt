Introduction
The use of social media, or social network sites (SNS), has 
increased exponentially since 2004 when Facebook was 
launched, followed by many other SNS, such as Twitter in 
2006. Given the worldwide diversity of SNS, it is difficult to 
generalize about their role, but they are primarily focused on 
supporting the networking of social interaction, such as in 
connecting friends. Nevertheless, the use of social media for 
societal change and political activities is potentially critical 
because these networks are formed around important social 
communities and relationships that could be turned to societal 
influence.
Despite famous examples of the use of social media such 
as in the Arab Spring (Rane & Salem, 2012), not much SNS 
research is focused on an overall societal picture of commu-
nicative power formation, including “networked individuals” 
(individuals as independent actors interacting via Information 
Communication Technologies [ICTs] with numerous diverse 
others via multiple Internet arenas simultaneously; see,  
for example, Rainie & Wellman, 2012), challenging both 
governance institutions and corporations, and the media 
impact in all this. SNS research has been more focused on 
specific political activities and networked individuals’ 
intended activities, such as building on friendship ties 
(Ellison & boyd, 2014). Studies of the political uses of SNS 
have focused on a general worldwide scale or on non- 
democratic, newly democratic, or relatively authoritarian 
national contexts (e.g., Bakardjieva, 2011; Bennett &

Abstract
The Internet can be used to reconfigure access to information and people in ways that can support networked individuals 
and enhance their relative communicative power vis-à-vis other individuals and institutions, such as by supporting collective 
action, sourcing of information, and whistle blowing. The societal and political significance of the Internet is a matter of 
academic debate, with some studies suggesting a powerful role in creating a “Fifth Estate,” and other studies challenging such 
claims. Research on this issue has not yet comprehensively focused on social network sites and those operating in a very 
liberal-democratic context. Based on an embedded case study of Facebook use in Finland, this study focuses on the uses 
of social media in building communicative power, such as in capacity to foster social movements in ways that conform to 
conceptions of the Internet’s Fifth Estate. The case study combines qualitative and quantitative methods to examine a sample 
of 2,300 Facebook pages and their online and offline activities and impact qualities. The results located 27 pages that reached 
a threshold we established for identifying online social movements with the potential for enhancing their communicative 
power, with a small minority of four cases appearing to have actualized communicative power. These findings not only 
reinforce the potential of Fifth Estate activity on social media but also underline the challenges of societal change in this 
predominantly entertainment-oriented social context. In addition, the study showcases the intertwined process of online and 
offline attributes affecting societal influence of online social movements.

2012; Lim, 2012).
This study explores the degree that SNS have been used 
for societal influence in the broadly liberal-democratic  
context of Finland, where national political–administrative 
traditions would be open to citizen initiatives and collective 
action. We ask whether SNS are used in ways that can enhance 
the relative “communicative power” of their users relative to 
other individuals and institutions (Castells, 2007; Dutton, 
1999; Habermas, 1996). Although the role of SNS in political 
initiatives and collective actions is a matter of considerable 
debate in Internet studies, various research has concluded 
that the Internet as well as SNS can play an important role  
in social movements and collective action (e.g., Bennett & 
Segerberg, 2012; Castells, 2007, 2012), civic political engage-
ment and participation (e.g., Feezell, Conroy, & Guerrero, 
2009), and civic corporate monitoring and challenging (e.g., 
Champoux, Durgee, & McGlynn, 2012).
Habermas (1962/1989, 1996) introduced the public  
sphere as an (offline) arena where individual people joined  
to critically debate and unite against illegitimate use of 
 power and state domination and theorized how this discourse 
creates communicative power. Flynn (2004) further explains 
that Habermas’ communicative power is “the key normative 
resource for countering the norm-free steering media of money 
and administrative power” (p. 434). Whether or not one adopts 
notions of a public sphere, the potential for the media and the 
Internet, in particular, to be used in ways that enhance the 
“communicative power” of networked individuals has been 
developed by a number of scholars (Dutton, 1999; Garnham, 
1983), such as by enabling the rise of a Fifth Estate that could 
hold institutions more accountable in ways analogous to the 
press in an earlier era (Dutton, 2009; Hidri, 2012). However, 
questions have been raised about whether communicative 
power online can translate into meaningful societal or political 
change as opposed to a form of “clictivism”—simply generat-
ing online activity.
The potential communicative power of individuals  
networked through social media is the focus of this study. 
Specifically, on Facebook, are the individuals networked 
around liking particular “pages” which are seen in this study 
as prime paradigms of “online social movements”, that is, 
collectivities of individuals using Internet and social media 
to organize and achieve societal change (Castells, 2007; 
Snow, Soule, & Kriesi, 2004), which operate today in both 
online and offline arenas (Castells, 2012), and may be capable 
of translating their communicative power into a Fifth Estate. 
Collective action is one of a number of strategies of the 
Internet’s “Fifth Estate” (Dutton, 2009; Newman, Dutton, & 
Blank, 2012), but this is a central aspect of online political 
and societal change that merits study in a particular online 
context. The Fifth Estate develops from individuals, enabled 
by ICT networking and sourcing information that is indepen-
dent of authorities, to increase their communicative power  
to bypass and hold powerful institutions of society (media, 
corporations, and state) accountable. We use the term  
“actualized communicative power” (ACP) in this study to 
denote the achievement of societal influence or change,  
conforming to the potential attributed to the Fifth Estate.
The key objective of this study is to identify as a specific 
case of SNS, online social movements on Facebook that 
exhibit a potential for enhancing the relative communicative 
power of their users vis-à-vis institutions, or others that are 
the target of their activities. This is executed by searching all 
Facebook pages within a well-defined population to detect 
those fitting a set of five selection criteria that are anchored 
in theories of communicative action (further detailed in  
section ‘Data and Methods’).
The study’s related objective is to detect those movements 
we have identified that make a difference and achieve ACP. 
We determine this through qualitative case studies of each of 
the pages identified as potentially relevant to Fifth Estate 
activities. In doing so, we also explore possible attributes of 
online and offline activities and impacts that appeared to 
explain why some pages were successful in actualizing their 
communicative power.
Given that there is neither accepted scale nor set of attri-
butes for determining the political or societal effectiveness of 
online movements’ actions, the article also seeks to move 
closer to a definition of the attributes and possible scales that 
could be used to compare the relative effectiveness of online 
social movements in translating communicative power into 
societal change.
Finland was viewed as an important setting for this case 
study since the nation is at the high-end in its use of Facebook 
(95% of all Finnish SNS users following Facebook; Statistics 
Finland, 2014a) and also has a global reputation for its liberal-
democratic political–administrative traditions. Facebook 
was chosen as the object of study not only because it is the 
most popular SNS in Finland, but it also offers the facility for 
individuals to create pages to network while also providing 
open access for researchers. The database of Fanilista.fi that 
lists more than 2,300 of the most popular Finnish Facebook 
pages was the source of the sample population.
The study sought to examine three specific research ques-
tions (RQs) in its main objective of examining the extent of 
SNS in building the communicative power of online social 
movements, the process of their online and offline activities, 
and their influence on the achievement of societal change. 
The RQs were as follows:
1.  How many Facebook pages from this population fit 
the set criteria of online social movements with 
potential for creating greater communicative power?
2.  Are there examples of pages creating movements 
with this potential demonstrating actual societal 
change in ways that conform to conceptualizations 
of a Fifth Estate?
3.  How do relevant online (online activity and gained 
membership size) and offline (offline activity and 
Sormanen and Dutton  3
gained media visibility) page attributes influence the 
effectiveness of online social movements in trans-
lating communicative power into societal change?
Communicative Power Online
There are a number of distinct but often complementary  
perspectives on the emergence of communicative power in 
the online world, including the ways in which the Internet 
enables individuals to search independently, and otherwise 
source, distribute, or leak information; network with others; 
and become sources of collective intelligence (Dutton, 
2012). The Internet’s role in supporting social or political 
movements can be seen as one important form of communi-
cative power. Social movements have been defined by Snow 
et al. (2004) as
collectivities acting with some degree of organization and 
continuity outside of institutional or organizational channels for 
the purpose of challenging or defending extant authority, whether 
it is institutionally or culturally based, in the group, organization, 
society, culture, or world order of which they are a part. (p. 11)
More generally, Castells (2007) has defined social move-
ments as “collective actions aimed at changing the values 
and interests institutionalized in society, what is tantamount 
to modify the power relations” (p. 249).
Social movements have been tied to the Internet as a space 
for launching or reinforcing their activities and interactions, 
and the Internet has been found in many cases to be useful to 
achieve their objectives (e.g., Zimbra, Abbasi, & Chen, 2010). 
Castells (2007, 2012) especially emphasizes the potential 
influence of people coming together in digital social networks 
and forming against government and corporations which  
formerly controlled channels of communication. These net-
worked social movements born in the digital age have power 
because they are autonomous, free from institutional control, 
and operate in different venues, such as online as well as 
offline social networks and public space. To some scholars, 
such as Snow et al. (2004, pp. 4-5), “social movements and 
the activities they sponsor” have become one kind of “a Fifth 
Estate” activity, as we posit in this article.
Dutton (2009, 2012) and also Newman et al. (2012) argue 
that networked individuals are enabled by ICTs to develop 
relatively more communicative power by sourcing and dis-
seminating information independently from authorities or 
institutions. Collective action is one of many ways in which 
their sourcing and collaboration might be used to exercise 
this communicative power, but remains one important 
approach. By linking up with each other online, networked 
individuals can enhance their communicative power relative 
to other estates (such as government, corporate, and media) 
and hold them more accountable, thereby challenging insti-
tutional authorities and power holders, and effecting change 
in policy or practice.
The written press, first described as the “Fourth Estate” 
by Edmund Burke in 1787, and later defined (Carlyle, 1846; 
De Tocqueville, 1835), has been a strong institution and 
societal controller/monitor in many liberal-democratic soci-
eties since the 19th century. The Fifth Estate reflects an 
additional source of pluralist accountability that might also 
shift the relative power of other estates in particular circum-
stances. Through giving voice and independent sources of 
information to the users, that is, individuals as producers 
and users of digital information, SNS tools can contribute to 
leveling societal roles and increasing citizen involvement in 
democratic processes (Bruns, 2007). For example, bloggers 
as a manifestation of the Fifth Estate have been seen as 
“watchers of the watchdog” in their power to monitor and 
hold mainstream media accountable (Cooper, 2006). Hidri 
(2012) further explains that the Fifth Estate is not against an 
extension of, or the end of the Fourth Estate, but merely a 
“new approach to building social reality outside of the  
dominant molds of media and regulations applied in the 
communication industry and production of meaning” (p. 19).
SNS and Communicative Power
Prime paradigms of SNS, such as Facebook, Twitter, and 
Myspace, are classified as venues that can support more 
democratic participation and expression, creating a place for 
people to communicate and network with people with simi-
lar concerns and interests (Lai & Turban, 2008). Papacharissi 
(2013) argues that by SNS a “networked self” can be actual-
ized, saying,
The flexibility of online digital technologies permits interaction 
and relations among individuals within the same networks or 
across networks, a variety of exchanges and ties, variable 
frequency of contact and intimacy, affiliation with smaller or 
larger, and global and local networks formed around variable 
common matter. (p. 208)
One of the most studied aspects of SNS has been online 
political discussion and citizen engagement. Research has 
shown that SNS group usage can have positive effects on 
political participation (e.g., Bode, Vraga, Borah, & Shah, 
2013; De Zúñiga, Jung, & Valenzuela, 2012). More precisely, 
Kushin and Kitchener (2009) found that Facebook, due to its 
unique features, increases the possibilities of political discus-
sion and bringing together people with different perspectives. 
Feezell et al. (2009) found that membership of political 
Facebook groups increases offline political participation.
Beyond the political sphere, narrowly defined, the Internet 
has also enabled networked individuals to challenge or mon-
itor businesses, corporations, and media companies: “Today, 
corporate wrongdoings, public gaffes, and unsatisfactory 
service that originate offline migrate into the social media 
sphere within minutes in the form of angry posts, wall-based 
conversations, and activist-orchestrated attacks” (Champoux 
4  Social Media + Society
et al., 2012, p. 22). Facebook, more than other SNS, has been 
seen as a venue for angry consumer groups targeting com-
panies. These outbursts are also often quickly picked up by 
mainstream media (Champoux et al., 2012).
At the same time, critics of this view have argued that 
political participation on the Internet most often amounts to 
little more than “slactivism” (Morozov, 2009). This term 
describes a feel-good type of activism online which is easy to 
do and which is a product of the click-based culture of SNS. 
Furthermore, SNS have been viewed as an inefficient venue 
of political mobilization because they are oriented to such 
low levels of commitment, which leads to protests instead of 
long-term political projects, and are not only perceived as 
self-referential and motivated by users’ personal fulfillment 
but also as lacking sufficient coordination and organization 
to produce concrete results (Curran et al., 2012).
The Finnish Context and Facebook
Finland is a Nordic welfare state with a population of just 
over 5.4 million. In comparison to 150 other countries, the 
World Audit (2014) ranks Finland as the third highest with 
respect to democracy, press freedom, and lack of corruption. 
Also, the Finnish culture is considered to be a consensus-
driven political culture, oriented to discussion and problem 
solving (Reunanen, Kunelius, & Noppari, 2010), and it has 
not traditionally been a foundation or arena for radical chal-
lenges against governmental or business organizations. In 
comparison to totalitarian countries where oppositional 
views and political movements are restricted or denied, 
Finland possesses numerous free venues of expression and 
networking for political action. Consequently, social media 
in political action is seen as having less significance 
(Nordenstreng & Wiio, 2012).
Finns, across both genders, are comparatively active 
Internet users. Official statistics (Statistics Finland, 2014b) 
for 2014 show that for the adult (aged 16–74 years) popula-
tion, Internet usage within a 3-month period was very high 
(92%) as was usage several times a day (70%). Finns are 
also active SNS users with 56% of the population being  
registered to a SNS (Statistics Finland, 2014a). Founded in 
February 2004, Facebook has not only become the largest 
SNS worldwide, with over a billion monthly active users 
and over 54 million pages (Statistic Brain, 2014), but also 
the most popular in Finland with 95% of SNS users as  
followers (Statistics Finland, 2014a).
Facebook generally comprises people’s individual pro-
files, newsfeeds, different applications, groups, and “pages”. 
Pages were designed originally to be used for real businesses 
and brands to communicate to the public (cf. groups for indi-
viduals’ usage). In practice, pages have been created very 
often for networking purposes by individuals. Pages are 
founded by one or more person as an administrator. They can 
be found and seen by anyone and are joined by “liking”  
the page. They have therefore become a primary space on 
Facebook for collective efforts at networking around par-
ticular issues or causes.
Data and Methods
This study applies the analysis of Internet and Facebook 
content, quantitative communication data analysis, media 
analysis, and case studies to determine the degree to which 
Facebook pages are being used for social movements and 
whether they are effective in changing policy or practices 
targeted by the movements. Facebook was chosen because 
of its nationwide popularity and because it enables individu-
als to create pages for networking. Furthermore, Facebook’s 
format provides open access for page-content research. 
While open groups are almost as open as pages, other types 
of groups are more restricted. Moreover, there is a list avail-
able as an online database, of Finnish Facebook pages, while 
none exists for groups, thus making a comprehensive group 
database for research less feasible to define.
Detection of Facebook Pages With Potential 
Communicative Power
The main data of the study consist of a weekly updating of 
the official listing of the most popular Finnish Facebook 
pages on the Fanilista.fi (2014) database. Preliminary quali-
tative reviews of this database indicated that activities of 
some citizen-based Facebook pages shared many features of 
common definitions of social movements and could be  
discovered through this data set. These online communities, 
if successful, should be capable of challenging the power 
holders of society and causing real-world power-shifts in line 
with the potential of a Fifth Estate. On the basis of develop-
ing definitions of online “social movements” (Castells, 2007, 
2012; Snow et al., 2004, p. 11) and the “Fifth Estate” (e.g., 
Dutton, 2009, 2012; Hidri, 2012), the authors set five selec-
tion criteria for identifying pages with potential to achieve 
communicative power and the role of a Fifth Estate. The five 
criteria are pages which
1.  Were set up by individuals acting with some degrees 
of organization and continuity;
2.  Use ICTs to enable creation of networks of 
individuals;
3.  Work independently, outside of conventional institu-
tional or organizational authorities;
4.  Use Internet-enabled sourcing and dissemination of 
information;
5.  Were formed for the purpose of challenging, support-
ing, or holding to account a societal authority, institu-
tion, or issue (i.e., seeking to effect societal change).
The process of identifying and selecting Facebook pages 
for in-depth analysis consisted of four phases (see Table 1). 
On 1 January 2014, the aggregate of the Fanilista.fi sample 
Sormanen and Dutton  5
(N = 2,329 pages) incorporated a set of categories (N = 142), 
of which the six most popular categories by number of pages 
(n) were Local businesses (n = 182),  Companies  (n = 155), 
Communities (n = 151), Musicians/Bands (n = 148), Products/
Services (n = 119), and Non-profit organizations (n = 118). 
The less popular 136 categories had a range of page counts 
from 1 to 85. These categories were combined for the pur-
pose of the study as “Other.”
When applying the selection criteria to each of the 142 
categories, only two categories were suitable for further 
analysis: “Communities,” which was populated by 151 pages 
and “Other,” which had a small but distinct category of 
Causes with 6 pages (see Table 1). As it was not clear whether 
all the remaining pages fit the five criteria we established, all 
57 pages within these two categories were reviewed and 
grouped into eight new categories defined according to  
the basic objectives and activities of the pages, enabling  
further evaluation of them fitting the main selection crite-
ria. These eight categories were as follows: (1) Discussion/
Entertainment/Informative (those whose main activity/
objectives include discussion and entertainment; n = 61),  
(2) Corporate/Organization (official corporate/organization 
brand pages; n = 53), (3) Cause/Mission (pages with specific 
joint social movement missions, challenging an authority or 
societal state of issues; n = 16), (4) Protest/Support (pages 
specifically protesting/supporting a cause/person; n = 11),  (5) 
Dare mission (such as breaking records; n = 7),  (6)  Politics 
(such as official pages for politicians or parties; n = 3),  (7) 
Spam/Advertising (n = 3), and (8) pages on the list but not 
found in Facebook (n = 3).
Further content analysis of the157 pages indicated that 
only two categories comprising 27 pages met all of the 
selection criteria: (3) Cause/Mission (n = 16) and (4) Protest/
Support pages (n = 11; see Table 2), providing a basis for 
addressing the first RQ. The final 27 pages were found to be 
formed in the SNS context by individuals independent  
from institutions or organizations and using ICTs to source  
data, to disseminate data, discuss, network, and organize. 
Furthermore, they could all be defined as communities with 
an aim of forming social movements and/or challenging 
powerful institutions of society over issues, and in this 
respect, pursuing societal change.
The study of whether a SNS enables an online social 
movement to enhance its communicative power requires a 
mix of both qualitative and quantitative methods to assess a 
set of attributes (see Table 3) on which the Facebook pages 
could be evaluated. The qualitative aspect of the study was 
made from the researchers’ observation and analysis in 
January 2014. Specifically, the pages’ offline activity evalua-
tions were based on observing page administrators’ and  
members’ page wall post suggestions, discourse of events and 
activities, formed events, and Internet sources and news sto-
ries related to their actualization and reporting of participants. 
The first example (translated into English) is of the Viking 
Line page administrator’s wall post discourse indicating 
offline activity (i.e., the leader participating on a ship cruise 
with other page members) and one member’s comment:
Greetings from Grace, from the first seminar on the brand new 
ship. (16 January, 2013)
Today trying the Viking Grace! 
 (January16, 2013)
The second example is of a media news story concerning 
the I do 2013 campaign’s sold-out support concert:
The since spring planned I do 2013 support concert’s tickets 
were sold out in ten minutes. (Hokkanen, 2013, 24 April)
Offline activities were also quantified from all the pages 
that had official listings of their events (a feature of Facebook 
pages). Thus, the specific quantifiable values of offline activ-
ities (see Table 3) were based on an overall evaluation of 
both aspects (see evaluations in the ‘Appendix’). The pages’ 
general societal influence (SocInf) was based on the research-
ers’ case study evaluations of either or both the mission suc-
cess of specific pages and any general societal change they 
achieved, which this study considered as “actualized com-
municative power” (ACP) and paradigmatic of an emerging 
Fifth Estate. The short case studies grounding the SocInf 
analysis are presented at the end of the ‘Results’ section.

Media analysis was conducted using two different search 
engines during week 14 in March 2014. First, Mediabase, a 
software tool, was programmed to subscribe to RSS-feeds of 
Finnish news and media outlets and enable word searches, 
and analysis of the news content was used to do Internet 
searches for the 27 pages’ names.
2
 By the time the analysis 
was conducted in March 2014, the tool had been in operation 
saving news content for exactly 12 months and included  
53 online versions of the most popular traditional Finnish 
newspapers.
3
Second, because some of the pages had been active before 
Mediabase was used to begin searching in March 2013, 
Google was used to search for the page names. The first 50 
returned articles for each page name were then reviewed. All 
the stored news stories were read and those made by recog-
nized online newspapers, TV, and radio, relating to the activi-
ties of the respective pages, were saved and stored. While this 
review concurrently provided a valuable qualitative perspec-
tive on the pages, the primary objective of this search was to 
count the number of stories mentioning each of the pages.
Table 3.  Attributes of Facebook Pages, Descriptions, and Value Calculations.
Attribute Description Measurement/calculation of 
quantifiable value
#1. Page type and 
purpose
The issue/mission of the page needs to be of importance 
at least to some segment of society for the page to attract 
followers
No quantifiable value. Pages are 
evaluated to have important topics if 
they attract members
#2. Member count Numerous members mean more are disseminating 
information and inviting others to connect, which will 
increase the allure of the page. Numerous members may 
also attract media attention and increase the image of 
power among societal power holders
Six largest pages = 5 points
Next largest 5 pages = 4 points
Mean 5 pages = 3 points
Next smallest 5 pages = 2 points
Six smallest pages = 1 point
#3. Media visibility Media’s agenda setting and power to shape opinion can 
have an effect on pages’ publicity, popularity, member 
count, officials’ and corporations’ attention, and success in 
reaching the pages’ objectives
An aggregate number of media articles 
found by Mediabase and Google:
>50 = 5  points—Very high
>10 < 50 = 4  points—Quite high
>5 < 10 = 3  points—Mean
>1 < 5 = 2  points—Quite low
<1 = 1  point—Low
#4. Online activity: 
administrators and 
members
Active administrators are potentially the driving forces of 
any online pages. They have to spread news of the page 
and when the member base is secured, they can activate 
the members online. Pages may also be active due to an 
active member community online diffusing information and 
activating others
Number of page wall posts by 
administrators and members:
>300 = 5  points—Very high
>100 < 300 = 4  points—Quite high
>50 < 100 = 3  points—Mean
>10 < 50 = 2  points—Quite low
<10 = 1  point—Low
#5. Offline activity: 
administrators and 
members
Social movements operate in both online and offline social 
networks (see Castells, 2012), and online groups have the 
potential of mobilizing participation by performing offline 
group-like civic functions (e.g., Feezell, Conroy, & Guerrero, 
2009). Offline activities may have an impact on members’ 
perception of pages’ power, attract more members, and be 
a way to get media’s and officials’ attention
Aggregate evaluation of qualitative 
case analysis of Facebook pages, news, 
and Internet, and quantifiable event 
results from Facebook pages:
5 points—Very high activity
4 points—Quite high activity
3 points—Mean activity
2 points—Quite low activity
1 point—Low activity
#6. Age The time-span of the pages’ existence may increase their 
potential for success and societal influence
48–60  months = 5  points
36–47  months = 4  points
24–35  months = 3  points
12–23  months = 2  points
0–11months = 1  point
#7. Societal 
influence = Evaluation 
of ACP and Fifth 
Estate potential
Regardless of pages’ objectives, their communicative power 
can be measured on the basis of how they are able to reach 
their end goal(s) and create concrete societal influence
Case study evaluation of pages’ 
objective success and/or general 
societal influence:
5 points—Very high effects
4 points—Quite high effects
3 points—Mean effects
2 points—Quite low effects
1 point—Low effects
ACP: actualized communicative power.
8  Social Media + Society
This study recognizes the problem that the “age” of the 
pages affects the results of the pages’ attribute results as 
some pages had been alive under a year and others many 
years at the observation period, but it still focuses on the 
entire lifespans of attribute results. This is because the age of 
the page is not a stable variable of, for example, how much 
online activity occurs on a page: Some pages’ high peaks of 
activity have already passed at the beginning of the period 
due to the specific mission characteristic, such as the General 
Strike which was focused on a 1-day event after which all 
activities and media attention vanished, and others continue 
as long-term projects, such as the Chow Radar page.
Attributes and Levels of Measuring Facebook 
Pages’ Communicative Power
One objective of this study was to discover whether there are 
specific online and offline actions and impact attributes that 
shape the relative success of Facebook pages’ objectives. 
Since research into SNS pages has not previously used this 
approach, a list of attributes was developed for this study. The 
study relied on (1) qualitative observations and the studies of 
other researchers to indicate which attributes were most likely 
to have the most significant effect and (2) an in-depth analysis 
of the six most, and the six least, popular pages with the attri-
butes. The authors finally settled on seven attributes that 
appeared most significant, all of which except for #1 were 
evaluated on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high; see Table 3).
The overall scale 1–5 was selected for consistency with all 
the scales, as the results could be adjusted to them in their 
overall result contexts. First, the existing member counts and 
months of pages’ existence could be indicated by an accept-
able value point from 1 to 5 from the smallest to the largest. 
Second, the overall results of coverage, lowest and highest 
scores by page, average of six smallest and largest, and overall 
average amounts of media articles found (e.g., n = 171,  lowest 
n = 0/highest  n = 79,  average  six  smallest = 1.5/six  largest = 27, 
and general average = 14.25) and page wall posts were used to 
set scales best describing the level of the action in their overall 
result context. Finally, offline activity and societal influence 
scoring was made on the same scale but through a more quali-
tative evaluation, uniting quantitative event notices to obser-
vation analysis in offline activities, and using the overall case 
studies as indicators of societal influence.
Results
First, because all the 12 pages under scrutiny attracted 
members of the public, they were all judged to be of some 
importance to a segment of society. In addition, we knew 
the sizes of the pages’ memberships—those who “liked” 
the page—and the “ages” of the pages. Hence, Table 4 dis-
plays how the pages were analyzed with points ranging 
from 1 to 5 (1 = low,  5 = high) according to the number  
of memberships, age, and the remaining four attributes: 
media visibility, online activity, offline activity, and the 
attribute measuring ACP and Fifth Estate potential, that is, 
general SocInf.
As SocInf reflects the apparent actualization of communica-
tive power, four of the largest pages were judged to have 
acquired very high ratings in this respect, noted by (5) influ-
ence values (see Table 4) and thus can be considered as case 
examples of pages with the potential for communicative power 
that actually reached a level of influence on society (ACP). To 
visualize how the action and impact attributes related to the 
success of the SNS pages, the other attribute results are dis-
played in Figures 1 to 5 in relation to SocInf values. A basic 
hypothesis common to the relationships displayed in the fig-
ures is that the value/significance of the attribute is judged  
in comparison with the page’s SocInf (equal or higher SocInf 
compared to each attribute = high significance of the attribute).
Figure 1 suggests four different types of pages (see 
Table 5). Four are among the most popular and influential, 
high on number of likes and influence, such as 875 grams. 
Three are low in popularity and influence, such as Hate 
has no room. However, there were some popular pages that 
had relatively little influence and less popular that had 
relatively more influence.
In the context for the size of membership (Figure 1), the 
results indicate that the common hypothesis is valid in 83% 
of the cases as the SocInf values are equal or higher com-
pared to member counts, but that among the other 17% there 
are anomalies. Among the four highest SocInf pages, the 
member count value average is 5.
In the context of media visibility (Figure 2), the results 
indicate that the common hypothesis is valid for 92% of the 
pages. Among the highest SocInf pages, the media visibility 
average is 4—media visibility roughly corresponds with 
societal influence.
In the context of online activity (Figure 3), there are 
interesting differences. On one hand, SocInf values for 58% 
of the pages are lower than their online activities; however, 
on the other hand, those that were relatively high in activity 
online did tend to have more social influence. For example, 
among the four highest SocInf pages the online activity 
average is 4.25.
4
In the context of offline activity (Figure 4), expectations 
are supported in that 92% of the pages that were influential 
had higher offline activity. Among the four highest SocInf 
pages the offline average is 3.5 with one major anomaly low-
ering the average, where Chow Radar indicated low offline 
activity but high influence.
The lifespan of the pages’ existence appears not to be the 
best indicator of pages’ SocInf (see Figure 5). Although the 
hypothesis is valid in 58% of cases, most of the “older” pages 
have low SocInf, and among the four highest SocInf pages, 
the age average is 2.25.
Overall, the first, but overly simplistic observation is that 
the size of membership seems to be one key attribute because 
pages with large memberships generally have more success 
in achieving ACP. However, there are major exceptions that 
are interesting alternative patterns.

In the following section, the case studies, on which the 
SocInf values were based, are covered and used to further 
examine the dynamics of the qualitative aspects of the spe-
cific pages to determine various success factors and, for 
example, why ACP was not the automatic preserve of the 
largest pages, and why for instance some pages succeed 
without offline activities.
Brief Case Studies
Although, especially among the most popular societal causes, 
there are various actors and campaigns involved in certain 
issues which had been in operation before the current cases, 
the pages presented here are identified by the authors based 
on the case study observations as the leaders and/or main 
actors of the specific causes. Moreover, the identifications are 
seen to be reinforced by the public, media and authorities, 
especially among the cases recognized as achieving ACP.
The largest page, 875 grams, had the greatest possible 
SocInf value. The father of a premature baby created the 
page. The page’s initial mission was to provide an environ-
ment that enabled friends to display their interest in the 
baby’s well-being. As the interest expanded beyond the cou-
ple’s familial, the father changed the mission of the page into 
an official campaign for collecting money for children’s hos-
pitals. The specific campaign, carrying the 875 grams name 
and the “father” as its public face, received high popularity 
among the (online) public and (mass) media. High media 
visibility is probably the result of high levels of administrator 
activities both on and offline, which was ably supported by 
the members, as well as celebrities who have supported the 
campaign. The media have referred to the page as a Facebook 
phenomenon (e.g., Tamminen, 2013, March 31). The success 
of the specific fundraising campaign has raised around 
€300,000 in donations for a new children’s hospital and 
helped to donate an incubator. The page’s ability to tap into 
people’s inherent empathy with the plight of premature 
babies and to raise significantly large funds indicates a high 
level of ACP.
The General Strike 15.10.2010 page, despite having the 
second largest membership that at one time peaked at over 
100,000, was unable to convert its potential into high SocInf. 
The page was formed to plan a general strike protest against 
government officials’ pay rises. Societal institutions were 
unsupportive, the media described the mission as a failure, 
and local government branded the strike and all its activities 
as illegal. On 15 October 2010, the day of the General Strike, 
less than 100 strikers turned up. Explanations of the mis-
sion’s failure may include, first, that the threshold of signing 
up to a protest page on a SNS is much lower than actually 
joining the protest and, second, the poorly planned and 
organized unrealistic mission lowered the potential of the 
page in the eyes of the participants, and the media and 
authorities did not grant it legitimacy.
The I do 2013 page achieved maximum SocInf value. Since 
March 2012, the Finnish government has been required by law 
to consider passing into law any civic initiative that has more 
than 50,000 certified adult signatures. The aim of the page, 
originally formed by friends, was to achieve equal marital 
rights for same sexes via a civic initiative petition. The mini-
mum number of signatures was achieved the day the campaign 
went public and within 6 months the Facebook page had 
become a registered citizen association; had gained the sup-
port of armies of volunteers, human rights organizations, and 
public figures; and gained a total of 167,000 signatures.  
The page’s “leader” handed the signed petition to the parlia-
ment proceedings. Although the parliament’s law committee 
decided against bringing the petition into law in June 2014, the 
parliament plenary session voted in favor of the law on 28 
November 2014 and historically approved the first crowd-
sourced civic law initiative in Finland. Although there have 
been other groups aiming at the same law change, and no 
doubt have raised awareness of the issue before thus paving 
the way for the initiative to be passed, the I do 2013 campaign 
can be seen as the main driving force of the final law change, 
also recognized by the media, public, and authorities.
The  Kimmo Wilska support group despite having the 
fourth largest membership failed to convert its potential 
12  Social Media + Society
into high SocInf values. The page seeks to persuade 
Finland’s public broadcasting service to reinstate one of its 
popular news anchors who pretended to be drinking beer 
while reading news during a live broadcast. What was 
meant to be a joke related to an alcohol control news story. 
The failure of the mission may be due to the fact that 
although people found the gimmick and its media attention 
interesting for a while, the issue is not close or personal 
enough for people to take more action than mere “like” 
clicks of support. In addition, the mission lacked recogni-
tion by the media or authorities.
The Chow Radar page gained high SocInf value. A collec-
tive of anonymous administrators created what they later 
claimed to be Finland’s most influential food media. The 
page’s mission is to reveal scams concerning the sale of 
unhealthy food and provide information on better options. 
The mission does not seem to need offline activities, prefer-
ring to operate strategically as an online source that uses 
public pressure to challenge corporations and officials. The 
offline activities in this case are the societal impacts, that is, 
consumer behavior changes. Each of the many online actions, 
for example, law petitions and boycotts, have been supported 
by as many as several thousands of people who have joined 
the actions and disseminated activity-related information 
through their own Facebook pages. Consequently, Chow 
Radar has received quite a lot of media exposure and gained 
the attention of enterprise corporations. We conclude that the 
page’s success in achieving ACP is due to its recognized role 
as a corporate, official and societal moderator, and source of 
information.
The Viking Line page achieved a high level of ACP due to 
achieving its aim of persuading Viking Line AS (a ferry 
line) to order its proposed addition to its fleet from a Finnish 
shipbuilder. A key component of the page’s campaign was to 
link “liking the page” to a promise by the members to use 
Viking Line ships at least once a year for 3 years if the com-
pany purchased a Finnish-built ship. The page’s leader 
actively contacted Viking Line, and once the page member 
count reached close to 20,000, Viking Line invited represen-
tatives of the Facebook page to open cooperation discus-
sions. In October 2010, Viking Line ordered the new ship 
from the Finnish shipbuilders STX Turku. News stories 
indicated a connection between the Viking Line’s order 
decision and the Facebook page, and the ferry line company 
legitimated the mission by recognizing its communicative 
power through cooperation.
The case studies to some extent explain why sheer size of 
membership cannot be considered as a direct indicator of 
reaching success in societal change (ACP). Two of the larg-
est pages failed in SocInf due to many factors. The Myyrmäki 
movement was able to attract a good-sized membership in its 
local environment and activate people effectively both online 
and offline, thus achieving average SocInf. The other smaller 
national Sensible days and Unusual matters pages reached 
only some SocInf perhaps due to quite low levels on all of 
the measured aspects.
Discussion
While the influence of SNS on societal and political change 
is a matter of debate, there are case studies of instances when 
online networks played a critical role in social movements 
and other Fifth Estate activities. The question not addressed 
is how common are these instances in the larger scale of 
social networking. This study looks at Facebook pages as 
prime paradigms of online social movements in one country 
as a basis for estimating the prominence of societally and 
politically influential sites.
To do this, with a step-by-step content analysis process, 
the study searched the Fanilista.fi database of first categories 
and then individual pages that could have a potential for 
communicative power using criteria developed from the the-
oretical definitions of social movements and the Fifth Estate. 
The findings show that while 2,302 of the 2,329 pages are 
corporate or business based or oriented to entertainment and 
discussion, a small, but visible and significant number 1% 
(27 pages) can be considered as examples of Facebook pages 
with potential to achieve communicative power.
We then identified examples of the Facebook pages that 
appeared to have achieved their ambitions and therefore con-
formed to conceptualizations of an effective Fifth Estate 
role. By evaluating the general SocInf of the six largest and 
the six smallest pages (by membership), the study identified 
four cases as having achieved significant communicative 
power: Chow Radar, Viking Line, 875 grams, and I do 2013. 
At this first analysis level, unifying factors among the pages 
appear to be their membership size, their ability to tap into 
the societal consciousness of people and to attract coopera-
tion and/or enough group power to force recognition in the 
eyes of legally or otherwise societally recognized institu-
tions/organizations.
Looking more closely at online and offline attributes that 
may be significant in achieving influence, the study selected 
five attributes (pages’ membership size, media visibility, online 
and offline activities, and age) for evaluation and compared 
the attribute results of the 12 pages against the SocInf values. 
The results showed that especially the online attributes (size 
and online activity), but also all the first four, were important in 
building success. Among the most successful four pages, their 
significance was in the following order: (1) membership size, 
(2) online activity (especially leaders), (3) media visibility, and 
(4) offline activity. Pages’ ages were not considered as reliable 
indicators of SocInf in this study (specifically designed to focus 
on the entire lifespans of attribute results) as the pages were in 
different stages of their mission: some old (failed) ones still 
alive on Facebook, but inactive and some old and new pages 
continuously active in both online and offline activities. Further 
studies should concentrate on online social movements’ suc-
cess factors specific to their respective mission stages.
Nevertheless, no one attribute appeared to dictate ACP 
alone, and their variance and aggregate impact should be  
further tested. By indicating and testing possible online and 
offline attributes to measure communicative power, this

Societal issue rises offline and/or is set on the media agenda
Offline societal and media focus on the ferry line’s 
decision to use either a national or a foreign 
shipbuilder
Issue discussed in media (stories decided by 
journalists) + discussion between media and 
societal power holders and in offline close 
networks of people
Issue discussed online in social media platforms 
(people source and disseminate information 
independent from press and authorities)
The influences of the ferry line’s decision on the 
future of Finnish dock industry discussed by the 
press in traditional media and by individuals in many 
online social media platforms
People organize offline in close networks People organize in online platforms (=networked 
individuals)
Online: Page formed on Facebook gathering people 
to join a campaign where “liking the page” is a 
promise to use Viking Line if the company purchase 
a Finnish-built ship
Offline meetings, protests, sit-ins, signature 
collections for petitions, collecting money, 
boycotts of products, and so on
Online petitions, protest websites, virtual sit-ins, 
online information diffusion to create boycotts 
or influence consumer behavior, and so on
Online: Discussion, diffusion, and vast amount of 
people joining the campaign
  Offline: Page leader contacts the corporation, 
meetings with corporate representatives, 
supporters’ collective ship cruises and so on
Media focus on the offline activities/impacts From online and offline activities/impacts the 
discussion returns to social media platforms
People link media news to the online page and report 
about offline activities/impacts on the online page
The issue gets more publicity Online activities and online diffused information 
get media’s and larger public’s attention
Due to the page’s high online member count and 
information shared by the leader of offline activities, 
media attention and online discussion escalate
The issue gets powerful institutions’, authorities’, or corporation’s attention Due to all online and offline activities/impacts and 
media attention, the campaign’s power is recognized 
by the ferry line and cooperation continues
Discussion continues in media and in offline 
close networks of people
Discussion and activities continue in social media 
platforms
Media report on the proceedings and the page 
leader and members continue discussion on the 
online page, report proceedings, and meet offline
Hypothesis Outcome
Discourse of the issue remains between 
societal power holders and media → citizens 
have low communicative power
Group power created online, supplemented 
with media attention → increased  communicative 
power of networked individuals
Online-originated citizen-organized group 
pressure and positive consumer lobbying have an 
effect on corporate decision making → increased 
communicative power of networked individuals
study provides further possibilities for examining how sig-
nificant the detected attributes are for online social move-
ments with different strategies and objectives. A number of 
factors beyond the attributes, and beyond the reach of the 
brief case study explanations, could also be seen to affect the 
achievement of ACP and need further research. Some of 
these can be classified as (1) good leadership and organiza-
tion, (2) provision of good background information, along 
with active information sourcing and dissemination, and (3) 
the crowdsourcing of freelance professional help.
This study concludes that in online social movements, 
online and offline arenas are interdependent in shaping the 
significance of their communicative power (e.g., Castells, 
2007, 2012): Unlike the “former” ruling arena of public discus-
sion, the press and (mass) media (addressing societal issues, 
which lead to offline discussion and at times also activities, 
which sometimes lead back to media agenda), the Fifth Estate 
arena also functions as a space allowing information input, and 
powerful networks, of individuals, potentially leading to con-
stant shifts of discussion and actions from online to offline, and 
back online. Table 6 summarizes how the Fifth Estate era pro-
cess of communicative power formation, supplemented by the 
still strong and meaningful Fourth Estate public discussion pro-
cesses (see Hidri, 2012), is a combination of case by case 
changing online and offline activities and impacts, where both 
are significant and intertwined.
Overall, although we conclude that it is possible for 
Facebook pages to develop a Fifth Estate role, there are 
high thresholds, and the emergence of social movements is 
the exception rather than the rule. This may be due to vari-
ous reasons. First, the number of potential online pages 
with Fifth Estate aspirations is low because the possibilities 
to create pages and groups for networking purposes on SNS 
like Facebook are still dominated by the entertainment and 
social functions, for which the site was designed. Although 
entertainment and discussion objectives do not necessarily 
exclude formation of communicative power, and might 
well increase the potential for reaching larger communities, 
these pages are less likely to pursue concrete societal 
change than to participate in activities that are social and 
entertaining. Second, online social movements may still 
lack recognition as legitimate actors of society as Internet 
and SNS activism is seen more as “slactivism” (Morozov, 
2009) and as motivated by users’ personal fulfillment, 
14  Social Media + Society
without the ability to create concrete results (Curran et al., 
2012).
Nevertheless, SNS do provide a platform for well orga-
nized and led social and political movements. SNS pages in 
Finland with a legal and culturally accepted basis (non- 
radical social movements) have gained positive reactions 
and cooperation from corporations and media, and, despite 
some hesitation, from political decision makers and govern-
ment. This may reflect a subtle shift from traditional repre-
sentative politics toward citizen involvement in decision 
making and their political empowerment in Finland. In addi-
tion, the press adopting news topics from SNS pages and 
their missions can increase the Fifth Estate’s role in societal 
agenda setting as so called “gatewatchers” alongside the 
Fourth Estate (see Bruns, 2003).
Conclusion
The Internet is an effective innovative public space, which 
has the potential to enhance social movements by facilitating 
individuals to network with other like-minded people in 
ways that can enhance their communicative power consistent 
with conceptions of the Fifth Estate. This study shows how 
the Fifth Estate can be actualized in the context of one SNS, 
Facebook. Although very limited in frequency, about 1% of 
Facebook pages created in Finland developed the potential to 
enhance the communicative power of networked individuals. 
No one expects all or most Facebook pages to lead to social 
movements—that would be absurd.
The importance of this study is that, first, the study meth-
ods reveal one way of detecting and content analyzing a SNS 
and drawing a picture of the Facebook “page” scene from the 
perspective of enhancing the communicative power of online 
social movements. Second, this study is one example of  
the possibility of developing operational definitions of the  
communicative power of online pages, although it leaves 
many questions unanswered. As neither a scale nor set of 
online and offline attributes against which the communica-
tive power of online movements can be measured exists, this 
study made a move in the direction of providing relative 
rankings of sites on critical dimensions of both. The study 
suggests that further research might advance the develop-
ment of theory and reliable indicators of the impact of SNS 
and their potential to contribute to a Fifth Estate role.
This study is not without limitations. As there are no avail-
able success criteria for achieving communicative power, the 
study relied much on the researchers’ qualitative analyses, 
observations, and judgments of the Facebook pages and  
their influence. Thus, the results are guided by qualitative 
assessments that are subjective but strive to be transparent 
and which appear to yield conclusions that have a reasonable 
level of face and construct validity.
Furthermore, a comprehensive database of Finnish news-
papers and their news would require purchasing access to 
each existing digital news media archive. Consequently, the 
study relied on other options, such as the Mediabase research 
tool, which provides good quantitative data but cannot be 
considered comprehensive due to its current scope and tim-
escale, and the Google search for online news, which usually 
gives different return results, and whose results are affected 
by the users’ Internet activities. Nevertheless, the analysis 
appeared to provide a relative ranking of media coverage that 
would be likely to hold up to the inclusion of further media.
The study gives a view of communicative power formation 
in a specific online environment, cultural context, and target 
sample, leaving room for various future research possibilities. 
Similar research could be replicated in different social media 
and SNS platforms and also in different cultural contexts.

... For some time in Western scholarship, the impact of various types of collective action (e.g., offline on the street, online on social media) have sparked up a controversial debate in the literature (Boulianne, 2009(Boulianne, , 2018)-with some arguing that online action is mere "slacker action" with little consequence in the real world (Sormanen & Dutton, 2015), and others arguing that online action can propel individuals toward sociopolitical change (Quintelier & Vissers, 2008). Over time, scholarship has made it clear that online and offline forms of political engagement are intertwined and inseparable today, forming a "hybrid" type of engagement in the quest for social justice and rendering slacktivism discussions obsolete (Milošević-Đorđević & Žeželj, 2017, p. 113; see also Gibson & Cantijoch, 2013;Valenzuela, 2013). ...
... In a similar vein, political or civic action on the Internet has raised concerns that it represents "slacker action" (i.e., action that satisfies a media users' need to become engaged with socio-political concerns, but has little consequence in the real world-other than heightening the user's self-esteem ;Hsiao & Yang, 2018;Morozov, 2009;Schumann, 2015). Put differently, Internet actions such as signing online petitions, liking political posts, using a hashtag as part of a political discussion, have been considered to be nothing but easy, low-risk, and noncommittal ways of feeling good about oneself, though with little sociopolitical impact (Harlow & Guo, 2014;Hsiao & Yang, 2018;Lee & Hsieh, 2013;Sormanen & Dutton, 2015). 4 See https://www.change.org/p/dogadan-cay-kad%C4%B1nlar-ne-ister-adl%C4%B1-cinsiyet%C3%A7i-reklam%C4%B1n%C4%B1z-i%C3%A7in-%C3%B6z%C3%BCr-dileyin 5 See https://twitter.com/Dogadan_Cay/status/593018497564835840 ...
... The academic discourse on political and civic action on the Internet is much less consistent, however, with some studies providing evidence for the slacktivism argument (e.g., Kristofferson, White, & Peloza, 2014;Sormanen & Dutton, 2015) and other studies showing that online political and civic action can, in fact, have very useful ramifications for change in the real word (Hsiao, 2018;Jost et al., 2018;Milošević-Đorđević & Žeželj, 2017;Quintelier & Vissers, 2008;Valenzuela et al., 2018) ...

... For example, Facebook contains today various communities formed by individuals concerned with specific societal issues. Many of the communities that protest against, or lobby businesses, often also attract news media attention (see Sormanen & Dutton, 2015). Moreover, Valentini (2015) notes that audiences have become more aware and sceptic of the tactics and marketing of companies due to social media. ...
... In recent times powerful online social movements and communities have emerged Facebook pressure groups monitoring activities of businesses and using group pressure to affect business decisions (Sormanen & Dutton, 2015). Groups also form in response to both poorly constructed news stories and the general activities of Finnish newspapers (see Uskali, Niskala, & Lauk, 2014) and bloggers contesting societal issues have become quite popular. ...

... Currently, Facebook hosts a large number of politically motivated user groups created by political actors and civil activists that reach wide audiences (Gustafsson, 2012;Park et al., 2009;Warren et al., 2014). Previous studies have pointed out that groups on Facebook can promote societal change and provide users with a channel for expressing counter-discourses to the dominant public voice (Gachau, 2016;Pruchniewska, 2019;Sormanen & Dutton, 2015). However, there is a darker side to social media, and research has pointed out the harmful effects of such platforms on political, economic, and social life, particularly due to the widespread dissemination of misinformation and hate speech through them Del Vicario et al., 2016;Gagliardone et al., 2015). ...
