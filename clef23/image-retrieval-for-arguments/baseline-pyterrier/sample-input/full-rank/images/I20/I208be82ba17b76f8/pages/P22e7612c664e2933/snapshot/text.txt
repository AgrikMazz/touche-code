Abstract and Figures
The present research studied the impact of three typical online communication factors on inducing the toxic online disinhibition effect: anonymity, invisibility, and lack of eye-contact. Using an experimental design with 142 participants, we examined the extent to which these factors lead to flaming behaviors, the typical products of online disinhibition. Random pairs of participants were presented with a dilemma for discussion and a common solution through online chat. The effects were measured using participants’ self-reports, expert judges’ ratings of chat transcripts, and textual analyses of participants’ conversations. A 2×2×2 (anonymity/non-anonymity×visibility/invisibility×eye-contact/lack of eye-contact) MANOVA was employed to analyze the findings. The results suggested that of the three independent variables, lack of eye-contact was the chief contributor to the negative effects of online disinhibition. Consequently, it appears that previous studies might have defined the concept of anonymity too broadly by not addressing other online communication factors, especially lack of eye-contact, that impact disinhibition. The findings are explained in the context of an onlinesense of unidentifiability, which apparently requires a more refined view of the components that create a personal sense of anonymity.

abstract
The present research studied the impact of three typical online communication factors on inducing the
toxic online disinhibition effect: anonymity, invisibility, and lack of eye-contact. Using an experimental
design with 142 participants, we examined the extent to which these factors lead to ﬂaming behaviors,
the typical products of online disinhibition. Random pairs of participants were presented with a dilemma
for discussion and a common solution through online chat. The effects were measured using participants’
self-reports, expert judges’ ratings of chat transcripts, and textual analyses of participants’ conversations. A
222 (anonymity/non-anonymity visibility/invisibility eye-contact/lack of eye-contact) MANO-
VA was employed to analyze the ﬁndings. The results suggested that of the three independent variables,
lack of eye-contact was the chief contributor to the negative effects of online disinhibition. Consequently,
it appears that previous studies might have deﬁned the concept of anonymity too broadly by not address-
ing other online communication factors, especially lack of eye-contact, that impact disinhibition. The ﬁnd-
ings are explained in the context of an online sense of unidentiﬁability, which apparently requires a more
reﬁned view of the components that create a personal sense of anonymity.

1. Introduction
1.1. The online disinhibition effect
Instant messaging, video chats and social networks are just few
examples of online communication frameworks that have shown
rapid advancement and growth over the last decade. Such frame-
works have become accessible to larger groups of Internet users,
who can connect with one another from their home computer,
laptop or mobile smartphone. One phenomenon that has been
shown to be characteristic of online communication participants
is the online disinhibition effect, deﬁned as a lowering of behavioral
inhibitions in the online environment (e.g., Dyer, Green, Pitts, &
Millward, 1995; Joinson, 2003, 2007; Kiesler, Siegel, & McGuire,
1984; Suler, 2004). Many of the human behaviors that are wit-
nessed in cyberspace, including violence, incitement, ﬂaming,
and verbal attacks, on the one hand, and self-disclosure, philan-
thropy, and the dispensing of help and advice, on the other, may
be attributed to the online disinhibition effect (Joinson, 1998,
2001; Kiesler et al., 1984).
The psychological restraints that often serve to block or conceal
emotions and undisclosed needs are found to be lowered in
cyberspace in various online interpersonal behaviors (Chiou,
2006; Joinson, 1998, 2003, 2007; Rosen, Cheever, Cummings, &
Felt, 2008; Suler, 2004). The negative online disinhibition effect is
the concept used to refer to the negative results of this loss of inhi-
bitions, usually manifested in aggressive behaviors that apparently
would not be exhibited in a similar scenario in the ‘‘real world.’’
Suler (2004) coined the term toxic disinhibition to describe phe-
nomena of online ﬂaming and acting-out behaviors that often
involve damaging the other’s or even one’s own self-image, with-
out any beneﬁcial personal growth. This can be seen in Pro-Ana
and Pro-Mia blogs (Brotsky & Giles, 2007), social loaﬁng in online
communities (Shiue, Chiu, & Chang, 2010), online gaming sites
(Williams & Skoric, 2005), hate sites (Chau & Xu, 2007), violent
pornographic and pedophilic sites (Malamuth, Linz, & Yao, 2005),
cyberbullying (Huang & Chou, 2010), comments on YouTube
(Moor, Heuvelman, & Verleur, 2010), online interpersonal relation-
ships (Barak, 2007), organizational conﬂicts (Turnage, 2008), and
more.
Flaming behavior—considered a typical manifestation of toxic
online disinhibition (Alonzo & Aiken, 2004; Derks, Fischer, & Bos,
2008)—is deﬁned as the use of hostile expressions toward others
in online communication. It typically includes the use of a variety
of textual elements, such as aggressive and hostile language,
swearing, derogatory names, negative comments, threats, and sex-
ually inappropriate comments (Dyer et al., 1995). Flaming behavior
can also be observed in the use of capital letters, in the increased
use of question marks and exclamation points (Turnage, 2008),

and in the mixture of letters, numbers, and dingbats conceptualiz-
ing shouting or calling a derogatory name. It can also be seen in the
use of color (e.g., red) or bold face in the script to express hostility.
1.2. Factors affecting toxic online disinhibition
Previous studies and theoretical conceptualizations have re-
ferred to a list of situation-speciﬁc factors that appear to account
for the online disinhibition effect—including anonymity, invisibil-
ity, asynchronicity, and textuality—in addition to personality-
related factors (cf. Joinson, 2003, 2007; Suler, 2004).
1.2.1. Anonymity and toxic online disinhibition
Anonymity, or the condition of being unknown (nameless) to
others, is considered a major determinant of disinhibitive behavior.
In an early experiment, unrelated to the virtual environment,
Zimbardo (1969) examined behavioral disinhibition by manipulat-
ing the anonymity variable by asking participants to administer
electric shocks to fellow participants. Some of those who were
asked to administer the shocks had their faces covered by hoods
with eyeholes and were dressed in loose-ﬁtting smocks, while oth-
ers had no hoods and were dressed in their regular attire and bore
name tags. The anonymous group of shock administers behaved
more aggressively, delivering longer shocks than did their non-
anonymous counterparts.
Although the concept of anonymity as a research construct is
being discussed for more than a decade (e.g., Anonymous, 1998;
Scott, 1999), it seems that confusion and misunderstanding regard-
ing the concept still exist. While referring to the theoretical model
of anonymity, Anonymous (1998) indicated that the concept was
lacking deﬁnition and basic understanding, and could be better
comprehended in studying mediating variables such as those re-
lated to self, others, and the social communication arena.
In an attempt to reﬁne and elucidate the concept of anonymity
we chose to refer to the unidentiﬁability aspect of anonymity rather
than namelessness. That is, other than being nameless we argue
that a major—actually crucial—aspect of anonymity should focus
on the unidentiﬁability dimension, which is quite broader and
more personally signiﬁcant than just being nameless. The uniden-
tiﬁability factor refers to the realistic condition of being unknown
to online partners in terms of identifying personal details, such as
gender, weight, age, occupation, ethnic origin, residential location,
and so on. Online unidentiﬁability thus makes it possible to use
real names while remaining relatively anonymous, as long as other
identifying details remain concealed. Conversely, in a face-to-face
encounter, people may avoid revealing their names and yet be rec-
ognized by means of their looks alone or some other important
personal feature (Bargh, Fitzsimons, & McKenna, 2003; Chester &
Bretherton, 2007; Giles, 2006; Valkenburg, Schouten, & Peter,
2005). Identiﬁability, furthermore, may affect a person’s own
behaviors and feelings even more than perceiving the identity-
enabled cues of others (Tanis & Postmes, 2007). Another implica-
tion of unidentiﬁability, particularly in computer-mediated social
situations, is the reduced willingness to cooperate (Cress &
Kimmerle, 2008; Kimmerle, Cress, & Hesse, 2007).
As seen with the shock experiment, anonymity may cause Inter-
net users to feel unaccountable for their negative actions, as they
cannot be identiﬁed as the perpetrators of certain actions or behav-
iors. This loss of accountability may result in an increased level of
toxic disinhibition, consequently promoting impulsive, aggressive,
and abusive behaviors (Christopherson, 2007; Dumont & Candler,
2005; Kabay, 1998; Suler & Phillips, 1998).
Several studies have shown that anonymity is a main factor in
inducing the online disinhibition effect (e.g., Bargh & McKenna,
2004; Bargh, McKenna, & Fitzsimons, 2002; Joinson, 1998, 2001,
2007; McKenna & Seidman, 2005; Spears, Lea, & Postmes, 2007;
Suler, 2004; Tanis & Postmes, 2007). For instance, in an early study,
Kiesler and her colleagues (1984) found that among participants
who argued over moral dilemmas using different communication
modalities, those who employed computer-mediated communica-
tion demonstrated higher degrees of disinhibition, reﬂected in
ﬂaming behavior, than did those who engaged in face-to-face
communication. The highest degree of ﬂaming was noted in
synchronized communication.
Although many researchers point to the importance of anonym-
ity in inducing online disinhibition, results from previous studies
are not unequivocal. Spears, Postmes, Lea, and Wolbert (2002)
found that anonymity in Internet communication induced more
incidents of ﬂaming than did face-to-face settings. However,
Douglas and McGarty (2001) showed that disclosing users’ identity
by means of their name or address (electronic or residential) in-
creased their tendency to engage in ﬂaming behavior compared
to participants in either anonymous or face-to-face settings. Aiken
and Waller (2000) examined the degree of ﬂaming among two
anonymous groups of students who participated in an online dis-
cussion. No relationship was found between the degree of contro-
versy regarding the subject under discussion and the degree of
ﬂaming. Since both groups maintained anonymity, the researchers
claimed that ﬂaming was apparently the result of individual attri-
butes. Such ﬁndings suggest that the role of anonymity in inducing
the online disinhibition effect is more complex than was previ-
ously surmised. In a recent experiment, Wodzicki, Schwämmlein,
Cress, and Kimmerle (2011) found that individual differences
among online group members, as well as the purpose of their par-
ticipation, interacted with the effects of anonymity on their infor-
mation-sharing behavior, hence insinuating that those effects
might not be general (i.e., main effects) but were moderated by
other factors. Chesney and Su (2010) showed that bloggers’ degree
of anonymity did not inﬂuence the credibility perception of their
writings. Also in the blogging arena, Qian and Scott (2007) found
that anonymity had little impact on bloggers’ self-disclosure as
reﬂected in their postings. Also, based on their experiment,
Flanagin, Tiyaamornwong, O’Connor and Seibold (2002) suggested
that the effects of anonymity on participatory group work inter-
acted with participants’ gender as men tend to maintain online
interaction with women using ofﬂine communication cues, women
in the same situations tend to employ reduced social cues.
1.2.2. Invisibility and toxic online disinhibition
Invisibility was found to affect behavioral disinhibition both
over the Internet and in ofﬂine communication. Although anonym-
ity and invisibility are undoubtedly related, they are two distinct
variables. Given that computer-mediated communication usually
involves invisibility—as most online interpersonal communication
is textual—it fosters a unique form of social presence that is de-
ﬁned by the degree of perception, awareness, recognition, or
acknowledgment of others. Invisibility renders irrelevant stereo-
types and prejudices related to gender, age, skin color (McKenna
& Green, 2002), physical attributes (e.g., weight, height, and gen-
eral appearance), stigmatizing behaviors (e.g., stuttering; McKenna
& Seidman, 2005), and physical and sensory impairments (Barak &
Sadovsky, 2008; Bowker & Tufﬁn, 2002). Diminished social
presence may lead to a process of communication-induced de-
individuation, which in turn may produce instances of disinhibi-
tion. Competing theoretical models, such as SIDE and hyperperson-
al communication, used different arguments and explanations in
accounting presence of others (Postmes, Spears, & Lea, 2002; Short,
Williams, & Christie, 1976; Spears et al., 2007; Walther, 1996).
Cyberspace allows users to control their level of social presence
and, thus, their degree of intimacy; that is, to control the amount
and duration of visibility or invisibility during social interactions
through the use or non-use of pictures, webcam, and videos. Thus,
N. Lapidot-Leﬂer, A. Barak / Computers in Human Behavior 28 (2012) 434–443 435
the absence of visibility and the unique form of social presence
inherent in online communication accelerate the processes of on-
line disinhibition (Morahan-Martin & Schumacher, 2003; Suler,
2004) because of reduced visibility-originated interpersonal
communication cues. Selective use of photos and videos/movies
signiﬁcantly contribute to impression management and online
relationships (Chiung-Wen, 2007; Suler, 2008; van Dijck, 2008;
Yang, Hsu, & Tan, 2010).
The effect of invisibility on behavior was originally studied in
the context of examining the conduct of people under complete
anonymity. Participants placed in a dark, fully padded room, in
conditions of utter invisibility, were found to exhibit greater
behavioral disinhibition than did an experimental group that was
left in an illuminated room under conditions of full visibility. Based
on this observation, the investigators concluded that visual
anonymity induced a sense of freedom from social norms and
restrictions, allowing people to manifest their feelings, whether
aggressive or affectionate, in more meaningful ways (Gergen,
Gergen, & Barton, 1973). In controlling visibility through colloca-
tion vs. distribution (through online communication) of working
teams to examine the impact on interpersonal relationships, Cram-
ton, Orvis, and Wilson (2007) found that situational invisibility
produced dispositional attributions rather than situational attribu-
tions, thus affecting team members’ satisfaction and cohesion.
Castellá, Abad, Alonso, and Silla (2000) presented ﬁndings that fur-
ther supported the presumed impact of invisibility on the online
disinhibition effect. Their study compared the level of ﬂaming
noted during debates in several discussion groups that employed
different communication modes. Although ﬂaming demonstrations
were rare, they were more common in the text-based communica-
tion group than in the face-to-face group or in a webcam confer-
ence call (i.e., a visibility integrated) group. It appears, therefore,
that invisibility contributes to the online disinhibition effect.
A different research approach employed an online survey, in
which the social presence of the surveyor was enhanced by adding
speech or by posting photos of the surveyor. It was found that post-
ing photos of the surveyors (whether male or female) decreased a
respondent’s willingness to reply to sensitive questions. The use of
telephone surveys and audio-enhanced online surveys yielded
similar results. Willingness to answer extremely sensitive ques-
tions was highest for online surveys in which the social presence
of the surveyor was minimal (Tourangeau, Couper, & Steiger,
2003).
Yet another study that observed the effect of invisibility during
online communication about highly sensitive subjects, such as
masturbation and shoplifting, yielded different results. Online
interviews with students were conducted via either Internet-
posted questionnaires with full invisibility or conference calls
affording visibility between interviewer and respondent. As ex-
pected, the respondents in both settings were more willing to talk
about sensitive behaviors than to admit to engaging in them. No
differences in the level of self-disclosure between the two settings
were noted (Mühlenfeld, 2005).
1.2.3. Eye-contact and toxic online disinhibition
According to Walther (1999) webcams cannot provide sufﬁcient
information about facial expressions and fails to supply the kind of
information provided directly by eye-contact.Barak (2007) empha-
sized this issue and added that even when online interpersonal
communication includes visibility, eye-contact may still be absent.
Webcams may allow visibility, yet they do not ensure eye-contact
during interactions. Hence, visibility and eye-contact are two dis-
tinct factors, each inﬂuencing interpersonal communication in a
different manner.
To date, research on the effects of eye-contact have been limited
to the ‘real world’ situations in regard to positive disinhibition, such
as self-disclosure and degree of intimacy. Nonetheless, it has been
suggested that the absence of eye-contact in online conditions
may promote the onset of disinhibition (Suler, 2004). Research in
the ﬁeld of gaze and eye contact in ‘real world’ found that the
dynamics of eye-contact communication greatly effects emotions
such as trust, security, conﬁdence, embarrassment, confusion, hon-
esty, admonition, and pleading. However, the actual degree of im-
pact of eye-contact on interpersonal communication is still
unclear. Some studies point to a negative correlation between eye-
contact and disinhibition. Absence of interviewer, and therefore
the absence of eye-contact, was found to increase the duration of
self-disclosure for participants who were presented with intimate
questions (Jourard & Friedman, 1970; Siegman & Reynolds, 1983).
Similar results were found for young children: increased frequency
of eye-contact proved detrimental to the establishment of under-
standing and rapport between an adult tester and the children: smil-
ing, by contrast, had the opposite and a positive effect on the
establishment of a relationship (Rotenberg et al., 2003). An experi-
ment by Doherty-Sneddon and colleagues (1997) had also pointed
to the major role of eye gazing on providing interpersonal feedback:
it was regarded as constituting a central ingredient in interpersonal
communication that visibility alone could not provide.
In a comprehensive review summarizing numerous studies,
Kleinke (1986) showed the signiﬁcant effects of eye-contact and
gazing in interpersonal communication. His review revealed that
they played a central role in (a) providing information (liking and
attraction, attentiveness, competence, social skills and mental
health, credibility, dominance, and communicating feelings); (b)
regulating interpersonal interaction (synchronization and regula-
tion); (c) expressing intimacy; (d) social control (persuasion and
deception, ingratiation, threat and dominance, escape and avoid-
ance, and compliance); and (e) service tasks (information seeking,
interpersonal interactions, learning, and cooperation and bargain-
ing). Additional reviews and models support the existence of these
dimensions while underlying the importance of eye-contact and
gazing in communicating supporting behaviors (Boyle, Anderson,
& Newlands, 1994; Webbink, 1986).
It appears that the absence of eye-contact has numerous, far-
reaching emotional and behavioral effects on online interpersonal
communication in general (Barak, 2007) and, presumably, on the
online disinhibition effect in particular (Suler, 2004). However,
no study to date has focused directly on the effect of eye-contact
in the context of the online disinhibition effect.
1.3. The current study
Many of the unique characteristics of online communication
have been cited as affecting the cyberspace experience in general,
and as generating the disinhibition effect in particular. Research
has identiﬁed several factors involved in either creating or moder-
ating the online disinhibition effect. It seems that a sense of ano-
nymity, invisibility, and lack of eye contact are dominant in
generating the effect, but other factors also exist, such as textuality
and asynchronicity. In the current study, we chose to focus on
three dominant factors with the aim of examining their indepen-
dent, main effects, as well as their interaction effects, and in an at-
tempt to examine the relative contribution of each source of
variance to ﬂaming behavior. Through employing an experimental
design, we hypothesized that each of the inducing factors, and
their combinations, would affect ﬂaming behavior. On the basis
of previous research, we further hypothesized that anonymity
(independently and in interaction with the other factors) would
show the strongest effects, followed by invisibility and then the
lack of eye-contact.
Theoretically, the premise of the current research was that the
mentioned factors (i.e., anonymity, invisibility, lack of eye-contact),
436 N. Lapidot-Leﬂer, A. Barak / Computers in Human Behavior 28 (2012) 434–443
and perhaps others, may reﬂect sub-dimensions that incorporate
into the general concept, the online sense of unidentiﬁability. This
concept will be explored later in detail. Even though these factors
usually intertwine in cyberspace, a controlled experimental design
could isolate each of the three factors, thereby allowing an examina-
tion of their main and interactive effects on the general concept. This
procedure would allow a better understanding of the complexity of
the online sense of unidentiﬁability and its relation to the toxic online
disinhibition effect.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
The study included 142 participants (71 men and 71 women),
all of them students enrolled in a variety of majors and degree pro-
grams at two Israeli academic institutions. Their ages ranged from
18 to 34 years (M= 24.42, SD = 2.97). Exclusion criteria for partici-
pation included lack of either basic computer skills, previous expe-
rience with online chat programs, verbal ﬂuency, or failure to
establish eye-contact in the course of a preliminary interview.
The ability of verbal ﬂuency and establishing eye-contact were
examined in a preliminary interview so participants that might
have difﬁculties communicating under the experimental condi-
tions are excluded.
2.2. Manipulations
Participants were presented with a dilemma to debate in dyads
through online chat. Manipulation of the independent variables
(i.e., anonymity, visibility, and eye-contact) was managed by
changing the experimental conditions. To this end, a 2 (anonym-
ity/non-anonymity) 2 (visibility/invisibility) 2 (eye-contact/
absence of eye-contact) factorial experimental design was em-
ployed to analyze factorial variance. Consequently, eight combina-
tions of the experimental variables were examined, thus imposing
on them an artiﬁcial orthogonality constraint.
Anonymity was guaranteed by assigning the participants ran-
dom aliases, with no further identiﬁcation. Conversely, non-anon-
ymous participants were assigned a list of personal identiﬁers in a
set order, as follows: ﬁrst name, surname, gender, age, place of res-
idence, major ﬁeld of study, and job held if employed.
Visibility was maintained by employing a webcam that afforded
each participant a side view of his or her partner’s upper body.
Conversely, complete invisibility was maintained by the absence
of this webcam.
Eye-contact was manipulated by employing an additional web-
cam mounted at eye level above the participants’ computer
screens. Partners in this condition were asked to maintain eye-con-
tact throughout the experiment. Conversely, lack of eye-contact
was maintained by the absence of this webcam.
None, one, or two cameras were employed in accordance with
the combination of variables examined: for visibility with eye-con-
tact, for example, partners could view each other’s upper bodies
through one camera while maintaining eye-contact through the
other camera. For invisibility with eye-contact, only the camera
that afforded a view of a participant’s gaze, and no other physical
details, was employed.
Communication between dyads was initiated by presenting
them with a dilemma for discussion. Each participant was ran-
domly assigned a partner; partners were randomly assigned into
an equal number of male–male, female–male, and female–female
pairs. Participants were asked to discuss the dilemma through
the use of instant-messaging software (Microsoft Messenger) and
instructed to attempt to come up with an agreed-upon solution.
The problem topic centered on the ‘‘life-saving drug dilemma,’’
in which a certain drug is needed to save the life of a person who is
close and dear to the participant. The instructions stated that only
one participant in each dyad could receive the drug, thus generat-
ing competition for the drug and requiring every individual to
convince his/her partner to concede; participants were in fact in-
structed to maneuver the discussion to this end. This experiment
design resembles previous studies in this area (e.g., Aiken & Waller,
2000; Alonzo & Aiken, 2004; Castellá et al., 2000; Dyer et al., 1995;
Kiesler et al., 1984).
2.3. Measurement of ﬂaming
Manifestations of the toxic online disinhibition effect were
examined by monitoring feelings and behaviors related to ﬂaming.
Flaming behavior was assessed by three measures: expert judges’
evaluations, textual analyses, and self-reports.
2.3.1. Expert evaluations
Four specially trained, expert evaluators assessed the level at
which ﬂaming behaviors were demonstrated in transcripts of par-
ticipants’ chat sessions. The evaluators were given all transcripts in
identical format and were blind to the experimental conditions.
They were instructed to evaluate, on a 3-point scale (0 = none;
1 = low level; 3 = high level), dimensions of ‘‘threats’’ and ‘‘negative
atmosphere’’ emerging from the transcripts. These two measures
were chosen, since they were consistent with previous studies
and conceptualizations in this area (Alonzo & Aiken, 2004; Barak,
2005; Dyer et al., 1995; Joinson, 1998; Suler, 2004; Suler, 2005).
Kendall coefﬁcients Wfor inter-rater agreement for these mea-
sures were 0.87 and 0.94, respectively. Mean scores were 0.48
(SD = 0.79) and 0.86 (SD = 0.79) for threats and negative atmo-
sphere, respectively.
2.3.2. Textual analysis
In order to obtain an objective analysis, pre-speciﬁed words and
expressions in the chat-session transcripts were counted and ver-
iﬁed by two trained counters. Flaming expressions that reﬂect
ﬂaming behavior included the following: hostile words and expres-
sions (e.g., ‘‘go home!’’; ‘‘this is childish’’; ‘‘shut up!’’); swear words
and derogatory names (e.g., ‘‘you’re an asshole’’, ‘‘you’re foolish’’);
direct and indirect threats (e.g., ‘‘I’ll get you!’’); use of letters, sym-
bols and punctuation marks conveying hostility or aggression (e.g.,
"Wellllllllllllllllllllllllllllll??’’; ‘‘@#!@#$$%@#@%#& "); and insult-
ing, sarcastic, teasing, negative, or cynical comments (e.g., ‘‘you’re
talking like a typical woman’’). These expressions reﬂected the cat-
egories suggested by Alonzo & Aiken, 2004; Dyer et al., 1995; Lee,
2005; and Turnage, 2008. The textual measure of ﬂaming was de-
ﬁned as the total number of these ﬂaming expressions. The actual
range of this variable varied from 0 to 117; the mean score was
14.68, SD = 19.07.
2.3.3. Self-report
A self-report ﬂaming behavior questionnaire was developed for
the study based on the Buss and Warren Aggression Questionnaire
(Buss & Perry, 1992; Buss & Warren, 2000). The questionnaire in-
cluded 34 items, to which participants were asked to respond on
a 5-point scale (1 = totally disagree; 5 = totally agree). Total
self-reported ﬂaming scores were calculated by summing up the
34 responses, yielding a total score range of from 34 (low ﬂaming)
to 170 (high ﬂaming). The original questionnaire was adopted and
modiﬁed to refer to participants’ feelings and behaviors during the
online chat. For example, ‘‘I got very angry for no good reason’’; ‘‘I
had trouble controlling my temper.’’ Internal consistency
(Cronbach’s alpha) in the present study was 0.91. The mean total
score was 67.05 (SD = 19.94).

2.3.4. Total ﬂaming score
Correlations among the dependent measures were between
0.45 and 0.68. An exploratory factor analysis, with varimax rota-
tion, using eigenvalue greater than 1, led to the emergence of a sin-
gle factor accounting for 65.5% of the variance. The total ﬂaming
score was calculated using factor-weighted scores, which ranged
from 24.72 to 179.31 (M= 61.84, SD = 26.44).
2.4. Procedure
Participants were recruited by means of advertisements
(through online and ofﬂine bulletin boards) that speciﬁed the time
required and the compensation offered. All participants volun-
teered for a 1 h study and, in return, received a free voucher to pur-
chase coffee and pastry at a nearby coffee shop.
Participants were asked to arrive at the experiment 10 min
apart in order to avoid face-to-face encounters prior to the start
of the experiment. Each dyad was divided and directed into
separate rooms that were identical in terms of size, illumination,
and background. There, the participants were introduced to their
assignment and presented with the dilemma for discussion. Then
they logged onto the chat to start a conversation with their respec-
tive partner.
The participants were unaware of the purpose of the study;
they were told it was to examine how individuals who were unac-
quainted with one another use online chat to discuss different sub-
jects. Participants assigned to the eye-contact group received
special instructions to ensure that they would establish eye-con-
tact with their partners. Actual eye-contact was monitored by
experimenters to ensure the validity of this condition.
The dyads were told that they had unlimited time available for
the discussion, that they had to reach an agreement with their
partner, and that they should direct the chat in such a way as to
convince the partner to relinquish the drug. These instructions
were given in order to engage the partners in discussion, to induce
rivalry, and to instill a drive to win.
Once the debate ended, that is, a decision was reached, partic-
ipants were asked to ﬁll out the self-report questionnaire and a
form that provided personal details. They were then debriefed,
thanked for their participation and asked to refrain from discuss-
ing the experiment or the facility in which it had taken place in
order to prevent any leaking of the experimental procedures. In
addition, according to the customary ethics standards, the partic-
ipants were handed with the researcher’s detailed contact infor-
mation, for obtaining additional information, copies of the
results, or other speciﬁc details. The data collection lasted approx-
imately 6 months.
2.5. Ethical considerations
The current study examined aggressive aspects of online disin-
hibition behavior, which required the maintaining of participants’
anonymity and secrecy. Therefore, participants were ensured full
conﬁdentiality of the information collected during the research.
All participants freely volunteered to participate in the study after
receiving information about the task involved. The participants’
activity was planned and directed to avoid harm and distress.
Deception was minimal so that participants received all necessary
study-related information without damaging the validity of the
research. Furthermore, the participants received the researcher
contact details, in order to obtain additional information, copy of
the results, or other details if needed, according to the customary
ethical standards.

A three-way MANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for
eye-contact (F= 3.02; p< .01), a signiﬁcant interaction effect for
anonymity x eye-contact (F= 2.09; p< 05), and insigniﬁcant effects
for the remaining sources of variance.
Table 2 gives the means and standard deviations of the total ﬂam-
ing score according to experimental condition. Table 3 shows the re-
sults of the univariate analyses of variance. As can be seen in this
table, the main effect of anonymity produced a single signiﬁcant ef-
fect: there were more threats in the anonymous condition than in
the identiﬁed condition (M= 0.59 vs. 0.38; F= 2.87; df = 1134;
p< .05). The main effect of visibility also accounted for a single sig-
niﬁcant effect: the invisible condition produced a more negative
atmosphere than did the visible condition (M= 0.99 vs. 0.74;
F= 3.76; df = 1134; p< .05). The main effects of eye-contact pro-
duced two signiﬁcant outcomes: self-reported ﬂaming was higher
in the lack of eye-contact than in the eye-contact condition
(M= 71.03 vs. 62.95; F= 5.92; df = 1134; p< .01), and the number
of threats with lack of eye-contact almost doubled that in the eye-
contact condition (M= 0.63 vs. 0.33; F= 5.11; df = 1134; p< .05).
The interaction effects yielded several interesting ﬁndings: the
anonymity x visibility interaction revealed insigniﬁcant effects,
whereas both visibility x eye-contact and anonymity eye-contact
interactions produced several signiﬁcant effects. In the condition of
a lack of eye-contact and invisibility, threats more than tripled
compared to the presence of eye-contact and invisibility condition
(M= 0.77 vs. 0.24, respectively, F= 3.24; df = 1, 134; p< .05). Simi-
larly, the combination of the eye-contact and visibility factors pro-
duced a negative atmosphere interaction effect: the negative
atmosphere in the lack of eye-contact and invisibility condition
was almost double that of the lack of eye-contact and visibility
condition (M= 1.15 vs. 0.63; F= 4.73; df = 1, 134; p< .05). The com-
bination of eye-contact and anonymity, too, yielded signiﬁcant ef-
fects. In the presence of eye-contact, anonymity produced less
negative atmosphere than in the lack of anonymity (identiﬁed)
condition (M= 0.74 vs. 1.03, respectively). However, this direction
reversed itself in the lack of eye-contact condition, with anonymity
producing a higher negative atmosphere than did lack of anonym-
ity (M= 0.94 vs. 0.75; F= 3.35; df = 1, 134; p< .05).
Table 4 offers the results of ANOVA for a total ﬂaming score. As
expected, the highest ﬂaming mean appeared for the anonymous
and invisible participants who had no eye-contact with their part-
ners (M= 75.95). Interestingly, the lowest total ﬂaming score ap-
peared in the same anonymity and invisibility conditions, but
with the inclusion of eye-contact (M= 49.32). As shown in Table
4, ANOVA revealed only two signiﬁcant effects: First, there was a
main effect for eye-contact (F= 3.54; df = 1, 134; p< .05), reﬂecting
a total mean ﬂaming score of 65.93 vs. 57.64 for lack of eye-contact
and presence of eye-contact, respectively. Second, there was a sig-
niﬁcant anonymity x eye-contact interaction effect so that in the
anonymous condition, participants who had no eye-contact had a
higher total ﬂaming score than did participants who had eye-con-
tact with their counterparts (M= 70.37 vs. 53.93; F= 3.24;
df = 1134; p< .05).
4. Discussion
Online disinhibition is a basic, wide-spread effect, associated
with a wide range of behaviors that have been observed among
many people engaged in online activities and interactions. Accu-
mulated research shows that disinhibition signiﬁcantly affects
modes of discussion, information-searching behavior, online learn-
ing, interpersonal contacts and relationships, and behavior in

groups. The toxic aspect of disinhibition has been shown to cause
various problematic behaviors in cyberspace, such as ﬂaming and
a negative atmosphere. The current study aimed at deepening
our understanding of some fundamental factors of the toxic
online disinhibition effect in order to better comprehend this
phenomenon.
The results of the study show that eye-contact has a signiﬁcant
main effect on negative online disinhibition, as well as on
self-reported ﬂaming incidents and threats. When eye-contact
was enforced, participants experienced fewer occurrences of
ﬂaming and fewer threats than when there was no eye-contact.
Anonymity, however, produced a signiﬁcant main effect for one
measure only (i.e., threats). Similarly, visibility exerted a signiﬁcant
main effect on a single measure only (i.e., negative atmosphere). Of
the interactive effects, four were signiﬁcant, all involving eye-
contact. It seems that although the eye-contact variable had no
signiﬁcant effects on all of the dependent measures, it caused more
impact than either anonymity or invisibility in producing the toxic
behaviors implied by online disinhibition.
The results of the current study lend some support to the re-
search hypotheses. Most notably, however, were the ﬁndings
regarding the relative differential effects of the independent vari-
ables. Contrary to the widely accepted belief, our research found
that it was possible that the eye-contact factor impacted more
strongly on the online disinhibition effect, not the anonymity fac-
tor. One possible explanation for this ﬁnding may be rooted in the
differences between previous deﬁnitions of online anonymity and
the deﬁnition used in the current study. Anonymity implies
appearing in public without an associated name or pseudonym
(Kabay, 1998). Derlega and colleagues (1993) suggested that ano-
nymity was equivalent to a state of unidentiﬁability. Thus, the
meaning of anonymity changes according to context: in paper-
based, hard-copy publications, a pseudonym can preclude or foster
anonymity and identiﬁability; in a face-to-face environment, a
name—real or not—may be superﬂuous for the purpose of identiﬁ-
ability. The ability to hold two-way communication in an online
environment implies that anonymity conforms in this context to
neither of the previously offered deﬁnitions. Therefore, the current
research found it necessary to study the factors of visibility and
eye-contact both together and in isolation. Consequently, the re-
sults presented here offer a more reﬁned view of the components
that create a sense of anonymity (which in turn induces disinhib-
itive behavior) in the online context.
4.1. Online sense of unidentiﬁability
To reconcile the prevailing deﬁnition of the general and quite
obscure term of ‘‘anonymity’’ as used in the context of virtual real-
ity, a more comprehensive deﬁnition is apparently required. The
present ﬁndings suggest that one can think of anonymity as an
assemblage of different levels of online unidentiﬁability, in which
non-disclosure of personal details, invisibility, and absence of
eye-contact compose the most signiﬁcant assemblage; these com-
ponents appear to combine in different degrees, thus yielding a
variety of ‘‘anonymities.’’
The new concept we refer to—online sense of unidentiﬁability—
can be understood as spanning a range, in which three major fac-
tors are considered: one end of this range is characterized by a lack
of personal information (i.e., anonymity), lack of visibility, and lack
of eye-contact; the other end, by disclosure of personal data, visi-
bility, and eye-contact. Even though the factors that inﬂuence the
experience of the online sense of unidentiﬁability in cyberspace
may also affect one another, their experimental isolation and
control were required to examine the essence and nature of the
experience. We should keep in mind, however, that the artiﬁcial
orthogonality constraint on the three factors does not represent
actual interactions and interdependence in the +complexity of
cyberspace. Nevertheless, the experimental isolation was
important for expanding knowledge about the nature of the
phenomenon.
The ﬁnding that lack of eye-contact induces greater
ﬂaming-related behavior raises the following questions: What
are the conditions that cause participants to feel that their identity
has been revealed? At what point during the interaction do they
feel that their inner self has been divulged and disclosed? And:
do people feel more secure in their online sense of unidentiﬁability
when their personal data are concealed, compared to having these
data revealed but eye-contact withheld? Our ﬁndings indicate that
in relation to expressions of toxic disinhibition, lack of eye-contact
leads participants to feel less exposed and more anonymous and,
thus, more inclined to engage in ﬂaming-related behaviors.
This novel deﬁnition of anonymity—induced by factors greater
than a mere lack of personal identity—is derived from the condi-
tions that characterize cyberspace, in which an online sense of
unidentiﬁability is one of several online experiences. Using the
components of non-disclosure of personal identity, invisibility,
and absence of eye-contact, the deﬁnition of online sense of uniden-
tiﬁability will change under different conditions or with different
people. That is, although the current study investigated the change
of conditions by manipulating the independent variables, the var-
iability in participants’ subjective perceptions of online sense of
unidentiﬁability may also help explain the unexpected ﬁndings. A
study by Moral-Toranzo, Canto-Ortiz, and Gómez-Jacinto (2007)
manipulated the anonymity factor, using an online chat environ-
ment in which participants shared their opinions on the issue of
immigrants. No differences in behavior were found between the
anonymous and the identiﬁed participants (whose pictures ap-
peared on a screen next to their full names). In other words, in
their own perception, the identiﬁed participants apparently felt
no less anonymous than did their counterparts in the anonymous
group. The study by Moral-Toranzo and colleagues, then, supports
the claim introduced here, that a valid concept of anonymity cannot
rely solely on the overall environmental conditions; it must also
take account the participants’ subjective perceptions of their sense
of unidentiﬁability on the Internet.
In the effort to identify factors that induce the online disinhibi-
tion effect, the present study constitutes only the ‘‘tip of the ice-
berg.’’ The effect appears to be a complex phenomenon, induced
by many factors. It is the interaction among these variables that in-
creases the complexity and often the intensity of the effect (Barak,
Boniel-Nissim, & Suler, 2008; Joinson, 2007). Thus, the uniqueness
of the current ﬁndings may both reﬂect and be considered a
manifestation of this complexity.
4.2. Lack of eye-contact and unidentiﬁability
The present study’s focus on variables known to lead to disinhi-
bition processes produced signiﬁcant ﬁndings that can help in-
crease our understanding of the behavioral disinhibition process.
It identiﬁed a unique psychological pattern that typiﬁes the online
social environment, a conﬁguration that leads to an interpersonal
dynamic different from other forms of human interaction found
outside the Internet. Although sorting out the relative contribution
of each of the variety of factors that inﬂuence human behavior in
cyberspace is undoubtedly difﬁcult, the present and previous
studies relating to the online disinhibition effect suggest that users
have a tendency to perceive cyberspace as a distinct, transitional
psychological space (Barak & Suler, 2008; Suler, 1999; Turkle,
1995; Turkle, 2004).
Despite the uniqueness of the online interpersonal dynamic, it
seems that the importance of the absence of eye-contact that
typiﬁes this setting resembles the role of this factor in general
440 N. Lapidot-Leﬂer, A. Barak / Computers in Human Behavior 28 (2012) 434–443
interpersonal communication. Eye-contact, or gazing, is recognized
as a direct, signiﬁcant part of communication and a meaningful
psychological factor in non-verbal communication. It is a condition
that affects one’s personal feelings during interpersonal interac-
tions. Studies have found that eye-contact plays a central role in
interpersonal communications for varied purposes, such as infor-
mation transfer, moderating interactions, revealing emotions, and
expressing intimacy; it was also found to assist in achieving social
control (Grumet, 1983; Kleinke, 1986; Webbink, 1986). During on-
line interpersonal communication, the lack of eye-contact has
wide-ranging implications both emotionally and behaviorally,
and its effect on online disinhibition in particular has been noted
(e.g., Suler, 2004). The latter effect, especially on negative online
disinhibition, was substantiated further in the present study:
compared to results obtained when eye-contact was enabled, the
lack of eye-contact was associated with increased levels of
self-reported ﬂaming incidents and threats, and with overall nega-
tive online disinhibition behavior scores. Lack of eye-contact was
also found to have a signiﬁcant effect on toxic online disinhibition
in interactions with the other factors studied here, namely
anonymity and visibility. Finally, an assessment of the relative con-
tribution of each factor to toxic online disinhibition behaviors
found eye-contact to impart the greatest relative effect.
It seems, nevertheless, that the ﬁndings on the essential role of
lack of eye-contact in contributing to online disinhibition are
preliminary in nature; it is still one of the very few research inves-
tigations that have considered the role of eye-contact in online
communications (e.g., Cowell & Stanney, 2005; Gamer & Hecht,
2007; Yee, Bailenson, Urbanek, Chang, & Merget, 2007). None of
those others, though, examined the role of eye-contact between
two people in cyberspace. There are no previous studies that we
know of that have focused on the effects of lack of eye-contact
on interpersonal communication online in general or on its effects
on negative online disinhibition in particular.
The technical complexity involved in such research may explain
the paucity of studies on this issue. As demonstrated here,
eye-contact plays an important role in webcam communication.
However, existing technologies do not support the desirable level
of eye-contact: webcams and computer screens are positioned in
such a way as to render direct eye-contact difﬁcult. Although the
solution to this problem is undoubtedly technological, the current
study demonstrates that it promises to fulﬁll an important psycho-
logical need. Technological progress in this realm could facilitate
the development of better, more meaningful eye-contact during
computer-mediated communication, and thus attenuate negative
online disinhibition.
Even though the lack of eye-contact may be a virtue of online
communication, in that people are willing to use online communi-
cation because they feel less inhibited, less formal, less embar-
rassed, and more willing to speak their minds because they do
not have to look or avoid looking someone in the eye, our ﬁndings
suggest that the toxic outcome of a lack of eye-contact might need
to be considered when initiating interpersonal interaction in
cyberspace. In this context, the research ﬁndings imply that allow-
ing webcams, which enable eye-contact, might have signiﬁcant im-
pact on reducing toxic disinhibition and its adverse expressions in
various online environments, including support groups, educa-
tional settings, and other online interpersonal interactions.
4.3. Limitations of the study
It is important to note that the current research employed an
experimental design hence its external validity is limited. Addi-
tional research is needed to examine differential and independent
effects of anonymity, visibility, and eye-contact under real social
situations. It should be noted, however, that although the gender
variable was neutralized by matching equal pairs of different
partners, gender and gender matching might have inﬂuenced the
results, and further study is required on this aspect. It is also
possible that other individual differences, especially personality-
related variables, interact with anonymity, invisibility, and the lack
of eye-contact, but such interactions were not examined here.
4.4. Directions for future research
The current ﬁndings suggest that previous deﬁnitions of ano-
nymity did not take into account all the factors that characterize
the online communication environment, speciﬁcally invisibility
and absence of eye-contact. Thus, it seems advisable that future
studies deﬁne the online social setting carefully and precisely so
that the effects of anonymity on the behavior of communicants
in cyberspace can be evaluated alongside the effects of other online
situational variables. First and foremost, it is advisable that the
presence of eye-contact (or its absence) between communicants
be assessed in future studies of online disinhibition. It also appears
that the term anonymity, as we know it, has not yet been adapted
to the parameters of the new virtual reality. Henceforth, studies
that include the anonymity variable should consider the broader
deﬁnition the online sense of unidentiﬁability: non-disclosure of per-
sonal details, invisibility, and absence of eye-contact. It may well
be within the purview of future studies to adopt the updated def-
inition of anonymity formulated here because it is tailored to ﬁt
the conditions prevalent in cyberspace. To recapitulate, such a
deﬁnition relies on the above-mentioned three factors, with the
relative contribution of each factor to the overall sense of uniden-
tiﬁability varying according to the particular Web application (e.g.,
dating sites, shopping sites, learning sites) and the user’s particular
attributes (e.g., personality type).
The role of eye-contact in the online disinhibition process
should be further studied. Given that a direct outcome of lack of
eye-contact is a decrease in the types of social cues available in
cyberspace communications, the speciﬁc effects of reduced social
cues on the online disinhibition effect should also be studied. In
particular, the absence of nonverbal cues, such as physical ges-
tures, posture, and oral and tactile information, as well as the dif-
ferences between writing and speech—all of which play an
important role in interpersonal communication—should be exam-
ined. Moreover, the differential effects of reduced social cues in
various communication settings (e.g., computer-mediated, face-to
face, and telephone) on the negative online disinhibition effect
may shed additional light on the signiﬁcance of the eye-contact
variable. Several studies of these effects have been conducted.
Walther and Bazarova (2008), for example, using a webcam,
audio-enhanced communications, or text-only communications,
compared face-to-face group discussions with similar discussions
over the Internet in order to examine the Electronic Propinquity
Theory (i.e., the sense of intimacy that characterizes each of the
above settings). A study that would monitor eye-contact, as well
as levels of online disinhibition, during face-to-face communica-
tions, synchronized and unsynchronized computer-mediated com-
munication (with and without audio accompaniment), and phone
communications may well help to elucidate the role of eye-contact
in the online disinhibition effect.
Interpersonal differences and their effect on the creation of
identity over the Internet warrant investigation, as does the effect
of asynchronicity on the online disinhibition effect. The interac-
tions between those factors and anonymity, invisibility, and the
absence of eye-contact, individually and collectively, in the social
online environment also merit further study. Finally, since gender
and gender-matched pairing might also contribute to the online
disinhibition effect, more research is required to determine the
precise role of gender in the online disinhibition effect.

5. Conclusions
As demonstrated, the most notable outcomes of this study are
the inclusion of variables that reﬁne our understanding of the
conditions associated with negative online disinhibition. Lack of
eye-contact plays a major role in triggering behaviors related to
negative online disinhibition. Thus, the professional literature’s
overwhelming attention to the anonymity factor appears to be
misplaced: the deﬁnition of anonymity reﬂected in past studies
and theoretical conceptualizations may, perhaps, be too general.
The current study suggests employing a new concept: Online Sense
of Unidentiﬁability. This term is broader than anonymity, yet it in-
cludes speciﬁc components; namely, non-disclosure of personal
data, invisibility, and lack of eye-contact (and possibly other signif-
icant components yet to be investigated).

... This result concurs with the result of the Youtube study. There is sufficient literature to assume that anonymity alone does have a negative influence (Kilner and Hoadley, 2005;Lapidot-Lefler and Barak, 2012;Omernick and Sood, 2013). ...
... Because, while we did not observe a strong negative effect of anonymity, we still observed that anonymity and identity factors have the power to influence participation. Together with the prior results of anonymity significantly influencing participation (Andalibi et al., 2016;Kilner and Hoadley, 2005;Lapidot-Lefler and Barak, 2012;Omernick and Sood, 2013), it becomes clear that the other factors are very powerful.

... Indeed, research has found that exposure to online comments with ethnic prejudices leads other users to post more prejudiced comments themselves (Hsueh, Yogeeswaran, & Malinen, 2015), suggesting that the communication behavior of others also influences one's own behavior. Fourth, and closely related to anonymity, there is the problem of the full or partial invisibility of other users (Brown, 2018;Lapidot-Lefler & Barak, 2012): The absence of facial expressions and other visibility originated interpersonal communication cues makes hate speech appear less hurtful or damaging in an online setting, thus increasing inhibitions to discriminate others. Last, one has to consider the community-building aspects that are particularly distinctive for online hate speech (Brown, 2018;McNamee, Peterson, & Peña, 2010). ...

... For instance, on the difference between cyberbullying and trolling, some researchers suggest they are discrete concepts, as cyberbullying tends to be seen as the more harmful behavior (March and Marrington 2019), whereas trolling may be both lighthearted and serious (Sanfilippo, Fichman, and Yang 2018), if not a positive behavior that can increase online community engagement (Cruz, Seo, and Rex 2018). Other researchers argue that social-media users may not distinguish between cyberbullying and trolling, since the perception of what is harmful and anti-social in online environments is highly subjective and contextual (Chen 2018), given that non-verbal cues here are limited compared to offline interactions (Lapidot-Lefler and Barak 2012). ...

Furthermore, current e-contact programs work best when constrained and moderated to ensure the positivity of the interaction, as research on online messaging has shown that unmoderated interactions can often lead to disinhibition and unwanted behaviours (Lapidot-Lefler & Barak, 2012). This reduces the potential of using e-contact in non-experimental settings. ...

The automata have configuration space {0,1}^{Z^d}, with d > 1, and they are noisy versions of automata with the "eroder property". The noise is totally asymmetric in the sense that it allows random flippings of "0" into "1" but not the converse. We prove that all invariant measures assign ... [Show full abstract]
