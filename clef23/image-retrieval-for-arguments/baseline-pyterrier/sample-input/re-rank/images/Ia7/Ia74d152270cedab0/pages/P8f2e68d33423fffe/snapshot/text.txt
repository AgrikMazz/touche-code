Abstract and Figures
This study explores the roles and powers of social networks formed in social media by focusing on the case of Greek anti-austerity movements. This study adopted two different theoretical models. For the roles of social networks, Kidd and McKintosh’s three roles of social media in social movements. For the power of social networks, Castell’s theory of network power was adopted. This study applied an automated social network analysis. It employed NodeXL to conduct social media network analysis and visualise the results. For the social networks, this study looked at three major social media outlets—Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The results can be summarised into the social networks’ roles and powers. For the roles of social networks, social media played a limited role regarding causing actual protests. For the power of social networks, social media limitedly has networking power, network power and networked power. This study’s main implication was that Greek anti-austerity protests can be re-emerged by social media, and they have some potential dangers. At the national level, the anti-austerity protests can hinder Greece’s democratic consolidation by strengthening far-right and far-left parties. At the European level, the protests can threaten solidarity among EU member states by enhancing Euroscepticism. Thus, it is vital to seek the proper measures to prevent further crises caused.
Moreno's attempt made the interpersonal relationship as a medium of scientific analysis methodology, and this laid a foundation for social network analysis research. 51)

I.  Introduction
In 2009, the Greek government announced its budget deficit, which worth 12.9 
per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since then, EU leaders have 
struggled to find out the way to overcome this deficit. Since February 2015, 
Eurozone creditors have provided Greece with the loan which amounts 
€ 
294.7 
billion, but it has repaid 
€ 
41.6 billion to them.
1)
 To deal with such a deficit, the 
creditors requested a series of austerity measures. Implementation of Greek austerity 
package has led to other consecutive crises such as a ‘health economic crisis,’
2)
 ‘a 
socio-political crisis’ and ‘a humanitarian crisis.’

This deficit also impacted significantly on Greek political atmosphere. In January 
2015, the Greek public chose the Syriza Party, the leftist and anti-austerity party, 
made a landslide victory by beating the two-party system (New Democracy and 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement) lasted for past 40 years. In June the same year, 
Greece is in default to the bailout fund, and this led following tough discussions 
between Prime Minister Tsipras and European creditors for having another bailout 
programme. On 13 July, in exchange of the 
€ 
86 billion bailouts, the Greek 
government must implement privatisation of state assets, pension reforms 
(abolishing poverty pension by 2017 and raising pension age from 65 to 67), and 
tax reform. 
Ongoing austerity caused the massive budget cut for welfare, healthcare and 
education, and led to lower income, fewer jobs, higher unemployment rates, 
decreasing social stability and increasing social exclusion, poverty and inequalities.
4)
 
During the period of ongoing austerity, young demographics were the most 
vulnerable and affected.
5)
 Before the Crisis, young people had been labelled 
‘generation 700 Euros’ reflecting their average monthly wage. After the Crisis, this 
labelling has been changed into ‘generation 300 Euros.’
6)
 Unemployment rates for 
15-24 age group have strikingly increased from 19.6% in 2008 to 64.9% in 2013, 
and that for 25-34 age group has increased from 10.2% in 2008 to 37.7% in 2013.

 The first wave was mainly about the anti-austerity mass protests and 
demonstration occurred in May 2010.
9)
 The second wave was recurrent of the 
previous protests and strikes in 2011. This wave shows not only the increase in 
participation

 but also an expansion of its activities
—
the occupation of central 
squares.
11)
 Mid-2012 onwards, the third wave of this movement emerged, and this 
wave turned the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) from a previously marginal 
party to a ruling party in 2015.

 The contents of such protests have been

 These works 
have focused on the social networks’ economic and political aspects of the Greek 
financial crisis. Specifically, this paper will concentrate on the societal aspects of the

The social network analysis is the method of this study. For exploring the roles, 
this study tests three positions suggested by Kidd and McIntosh.
17)
 The first 
position is the techno-optimism. In this position, social media technologies can 
solve social problems (in here, they are anti-austerity protests). The second one is 
techno-pessimism. In this position, the social media’s roles are either superficial or 
exaggerated. The last one is techno-ambivalence, which falls in the middle of the 
spectrum between the two positions above.
18)
 The researchers in this position claim 
that the role of social media is somewhat limited in several specified areas. For 
example, Murthy argues that Twitter played several possible roles: 1) real-time 
information streamers, 2) a means for information updates, 3) a means to organise 
disparate activist groups on the ground.
19)
 
For exploring power, this study tests four different forms of power: networking 
power, network power, networked power and network-making power.
20)
 The first 
one refers to the power deriving from actors and organisations in the networks.

The second one means that the power is coming from coordinating social 
interactions in the networks. The third one is the power coming from the influence 
chain between some actors and other actors. The last one is the power to 
programme specific networks and the power to switch different networks.
21)
 For 
the data analysis and visualisation, this paper employed NodeXL. Afterwards, this 
paper will conclude by discussing the social media’s role and impact on 
anti-austerity protests of the Greek financial crisis.  The research questions of this 
paper are as follows.
(1) What are the roles of the social network in social media have on 
anti-austerity protests?
(2) What kind of power is there in the social network in the social media on 
anti-austerity protests?
II.  Conceptual  Frameworks
1  Theoretical  Frameworks
1) Three Roles of the Social Media
Kidd and McIntosh asked this question “what role do the social media play in 
social movements and political unrest?” to explore the relationship between social 
networking and social movements.
22)
 After reviewing existing literature, they 
provided three different groupings of the social media’s influence upon social 
movements: techno-optimism, techno-pessimism and techno-ambivalent. 
Techno-optimism refers to those approaches that emphasise the potential of social 
media technologies to solve social problems. In techno-optimism, Castells 
emphasised the power of the network and the real power of the network come

from members of the information society.
23)
 In other words, social media plays a 
vital role in forming the power of network and influence significantly upon forming 
social movements. One of his recent volumes provided the different cases of social 
movements in the world like Tunisia’s Jasmine Revolution, Iceland’s Kitchenware 
Revolution, Egyptian Revolution, Arab Uprisings Violence, and Rhizomatic 
Revolution (
Indignadas
 in Spain).
24)
 In addition, Lotan and their colleagues 
investigated social media’s (Twitter) influence upon Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings, 
and they drew a couple of conclusions: 1) the social media has changed the format 
of journalism
—
a conversation across diverse ranges of actors
—
and, 2) within the 
network, activists and bloggers are vital sources of information.
25)
 The active 
member of the network seemed to be agenda-setters in this movement. Tugekci and 
Wilson attempted to find out the impact of social media on Egypt’s Tahrir Square 
protests participants by conducting surveys.
26)
 They suggested Facebook and Twitter 
were important social media in the protest which led to the resignation of Egyptian 
President Mubarak.
Techno-pessimism characterises the work of those who consider the promises of 
social media to be hyperbolic and superficial. In techno-pessimism, Morozov 
suggests cyber-realism which says that social media is not a catalyst for social 
movements, but the significant catalysts are traditional social, political and economic 
arrangements.
27)
 Hassanpour supports techno-pessimism because the demographics

can find out alternative sources of communication for the protests in case of 
blackouts of social media platforms.
28)
 Christensen pointed out the social media can 
be a useful tool for the protestors, but we should not have the implicit trust of 
social media in the cases of protests.
29)
Techno-ambivalence prefers to take an intermediary position between two 
previously mentioned positions. In techno-ambivalence, the researchers believe the 
impact of social media bears ambiguity, so they maintain their critical attitudes by 
assessing the limitations of such technology. Murthy’s work explores social media’s 
role in activism on Arab Springs.
30)
 Murthy suggested that it is impossible to 
measure the relevance of Twitter upon the revolution, but Twitter served specific 
roles for the revolution: a real-time information stream for local consumption, a 
tool for disseminating local information for international audiences, and a tool to 
“organise disparate activist groups on the ground.”
31)
 Murthy believes the second 
and third roles might have a great impact. Gerbaudo explored and compared the 
cases of Cairo uprisings, the Spanish Indignados movement and Occupy Wall Street 
for assessing the level of power of social media in case of social movements.
32)
 He 
presented that social media played a crucial role in Egypt and Spain cases, but the 
social media were underused in the Occupy movement. Kamel employed the 
ambivalent approach to explore the socio-political transformation of Egypt.

 Kreiss and Tufekci’s 
study was on the social media’s ambivalence in the context of the Occupy 
movement).
35)
 Poell investigated on Toronto Community Mobilisation Network and 
illustrated the ambiguous nature of social media.
36)
 Kidd and McIntosh concluded 
that the substantial form of the impact of social media could be ambiguous, but 
social media will be retained as a useful tool for the social movement.
37)
2) Castells' Network Theory of Power
Castells believes that network can exhibit its power in society.
38)
 He claims the 
power in the network consists of four different forms of power: 1) 
Networking 
Power 
(focusing on the power of members or organisations within the specific 
network); 2) 
Network Power 
(focusing on the power come from social interaction 
process); 3) 
Networked Power
 (focusing on a group of specific actors’ power upon 
other group of other social actors within the network); and, 4) 
Network-making 
Power
 (focusing on the power to programme specific network and the power to 
switch different networks or forming alliances between dominant actors of various 
networks).
Considering the global cases of a social movement, revealing the relations 
between Greek anti-austerity movement and social media deserves its academic 
attention. The literature exploring such relations pointed out the social media has 
several significant roles in this movement by enabling the creation of 
“representations and reverberations,”

 The 
interaction between social media and this movement has recently received a 
considerable amount of attention, but the literature focused on Twitter.
43)
 Triliva et 
al. focused on the case of YouTube’s influence upon this movement by conducting 
multimodal analysis on the contents of five main videos related to the movement.
44)
 
This paper found that Facebook was neglected as the research medium despite its 
influence upon this movement. Also, there is no comprehensive study based on the 
various medium of social media. Thus, for filling in the gap of the literature, this 
study will cover Greece’s leading social media platforms

Facebook, Twitter and

Edge A line trying nodes to represent their relationship
Degree
Centrali ty
It assigns an importance score based purely on the number of links 
held by each node. It is the most straightforward measure of node 
connectivity.  The  results  are  usually  presented  in  the  forms  of 
in-degree  (number  of  inbound  links)  and  out-degree  (number  of 
outbound  links).
Closeness 
Centrali ty
It measures scores each node based on their closeness to all other 
nodes within the network. Finding out good disseminator is useful.
Betweenness
Centrali ty
It  measures  the  number  of  times  a  node  lies  on  the  shortest  path 
between other nodes. It is useful for analysing communication 
dynamics finding out who holds authority over. 
Eigenvector 
Centrali ty
It measures a node’s influence based on the number of links it has 
to  other  nodes  within  the  network. 
Page  Rank It  determines  the  importance  of  a  node  based  on  its  position  in the 
network.
Density How  highly  connected  the nodes  are  by  calculating  the  percentage  of 
all  possible  connections  in  the  whole  network.

2) Data Collection and Analysis
This paper conducted a social network analysis of three representative social 
media
—
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The first step of social network analysis, 
selecting the appropriate keywords are the preliminary and vital task. Throughout 
considering proper keywords, this paper considered a range of keywords used in the 
empirical studies, such as SYRIZA, Greece;
57)
 Greek Indignados, Aganaktismenoi, 
populism, SYRIZA;
58)
 and Greek Elections and Economic Crisis.
59)
 After 
considering these keywords, this study paid special attention to Theocharis’ study on 
social network analysis of Greek anti-austerity movement. He drew two most widely 
used hashtags during the period: #greekrevolution and #25Mgr (which roughly 
translated as May 25, the date of the grand protest in 2011).
60)
 This study selected 
greek revolution
 as the keyword for exploring the social network of 
Aganaktismenoi
 movement.
61)
 However, this study did not consider another 
hashtag keyword (#25Mgr) because it would draw a limited range of information. 
For analysing Facebook network, this study employed NodeXL

social network analysis. The NodeXL Facebook Fan Page Network data collector

can perform the network of a specific Facebook page. In the case of Greek 
anti-austerity movement, this study selected this movement’s most popular Facebook 
Fan Page (50,689 likes and 49,179 followers, October 31, 2018). The full name of 
this page is 
Αγανακτισμένοι  Αποφασισμένοι  Έλληνες
 
(

) which is Greek Determined Indignant in English. The 
screenshot of this page is provided in Figure 2.

This page was opened in August 2011, during the first wave of Greek 
anti-austerity protests. On the left-hand side of this page, there is a strong profile 
photo containing an image of the fist printed the Greek flag with a phrase “

For investigating Facebook Network of Greek anti-austerity protests, this study 
used a Facebook Fan Page Network data collector featured in NodeXL. For the 
medium of analysis, this study chose the most popular Facebook page related to 
this movement. This study put its Facebook id. (@apofasismenoi) into Name/ID 
226  제10권 1집(통권 제18호, 2019년 3월)
row space and this study set the data collection period from the time of 
establishment of this page to the end of 2017 (Figure 3).

For exploring Greek anti-austerity protests network formed on Twitter, this paper 
employed Twitter Users Network data collector featured in NodeXL. This study put 
#greekrevolution
 as a keyword into the data collector. The results set of up to 
18,000 tweets, but less likely to collect the full amount of messages. Also, the 
service does not return the data of secured users into the data set so that the data 
collection process can be limited. The data import process is presented in Figure 4.

 as a keyword into the data collector. This paper put 500 videos as 
the maximum number of videos which is a limit of the data collector. The data 
import process is presented in Figure 5.

IV.  Results
After collecting all the data from these three leading social media, NodeXL 
worked out the values of SNA’s measurement. The overview of the results is in

In Table 5, the Facebook Fan Page network has more nodes than Twitter and 
YouTube networks. Looking at edges (the relationship between the nodes), 
Facebook outnumbers Twitter and YouTube. For Twitter Network, it is difficult to 
compare because of secured users who were not included in the networks. 
However, comparing with YouTube, the value was similar to each other so that 
YouTube can disseminate their message efficiently to the members of the society 
like Facebook Fan Page. Regarding density, YouTube Network is denser than 
Greek Anti-aust eri ty  Movements i n Soci al Media: The Roles and Powers of Social Networks
  229
Twitter and Facebook respectively. The 
geodesic distance
 is a useful measure to 
explore social relationships between the nodes in the network. When the social 
distance is close between nodes, the value will be presented as the lower number. 
Looking at the results, the nodes in the YouTube network have closer social 
relationships than Facebook and Twitter Networks. 
For the 
degree centrality
, it is difficult for us to compare the values between 
these three social media. For the 
betweenness centrality
, when the value is high, 
there are more nodes (individuals) who can control information flow and exchange 
among the nodes in the network. In Table 5, the Facebook network featured more 
significant information gatekeepers than Twitter and YouTube. For the closeness 
centrality, when the value is high, the network has more users who can perform 
quicker information diffusion to the other nodes in the network. Among the three 
social media, YouTube is an active information diffuser than Twitter and Facebook 
respectively. For eigenvector centrality, we could identify the nodes that can 
influence the whole network. When the value is high, there is an evident influencer 
in the network. In the case of this paper, the Twitter network has an overall 
influencer in the network than YouTube and Facebook. The visualised social 
networks are presented in Figure 6 (Facebook), 7 (Twitter) and 8 (YouTube).

Figure  6.  Facebook Page  Network  of  Greek  Anti-austerity  Movement
Figure 6 shows the groupings of networks during the last seven years of Greek 
anti-austerity protests. 141 subgroupings were found within this network. The first 
three most significant subgroups have more than 1,000 nodes (G1 1874, G2 1230 
and G3 1127). G1 is in navy blue the largest one and the most influential upon 
other minor subgroups. G2 is in sky blue which is less dense than the previous 
one. G3 is in green and less influential than two previous groups. For the next 
group of subgroups (G4 to G20), they had 115 nodes to 37 nodes. The last group 
of the subgroups (G21 to G141) had less than 15 nodes per group.

Figure 7 presents the Twitter Search Network of Greek anti-austerity protests. 
Opposite from Facebook Network, this network has more secured members, so the 
number of available nodes was not satisfactory. In the data, there are four 
subgroups, but no impressive core nodes were found except the G1. The core node 
of the G1 was @skaigr, the official Twitter account of 
Skai
 TV
—
one of the largest 
media organisations in Greece which owns a television network based in Piraeus, 
Greece. This provider mainly focuses on airing entertainment and news programmes 
to the Greek public. The other three groups retweeted the message released by 
Skai
 
TV, so this media group has the most significant impact on this network.

Movement. 
Within this dense network, we could find out one outstanding node with the 
highest number of views (5,109,554 views). Sabaton is the channel of Swedish 
power metal band whose main themes of their lyrics are based on war, battles and 
acts of heroism.
62)
 The title of this video was the official animated video of this 
band’s song “Coat of Arms” which was created on September 13, 2012. The lyrics 
of the song was based on Greek historical event
—
the 
Ohi
 (which means ‘no’) Day 
(28
th
 October). This event is originated from the Greek prime minister’s rejection of 
Italian dictator Mussolini's ultimatum on 28 October 1940. Subsequently, the Italian 
army attacked Greece, and this became Greece’s participation in World War II. 
After the War, this day became a national holiday in Greece that commemorates 
the Greek government’s nationalistic rejection to its external powers.

messages in its lyrics, Sabaton’s song--Coat of Arms

became the symbolic song for 
anti-austerity rallies in Greece. In 2015, when Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras 
called for a referendum accepting a set of economic reforms in exchange of bailout 
money from the European Union. Before the referendum, Tsipras gave a speech by 
saying “I call on you to say a big ‘no’ to ultimatums, ‘no’ to blackmail” and “Turn 
your back on those who would terrorise you”.
64)
 As a result, 61% of the Greek 
public voted no (
Ohi
) to the referendum. Revising the video, which had the highest 
number of viewers, Sabaton’s Coat of Arms can be interpreted as the resonance of 
the Greek public’s resistance to their unfavourable austerity deal.
V.  Discussion  and  Concluding  Remarks
So far, this study has looked at the social networks among three main social 
media to explore the roles and powers of these networks in Greek anti-austerity 
movements. For answering the first research question, it is necessary to revisit social 
media’s three significant roles in light of the results of this study. Regarding the role 
of techno-optimism, social media could not improve the current situation in Greece 
regarding drawing a proper solution to the Greek austerity measures. Facebook 
page’s most extensive network could not stop the protests in Greece. Preferably, 
the photo of its front page implies the Greek people’s resistance to the 
government’s austerity policies. In the YouTube network of this study, the results 
show that the public was more likely to watch the video containing stronger 
resistance message. In the lens of techno-pessimism, social media brought about 
unexpected consequence. Since the Greek financial crisis, the collective experience 
of society’s rapid disintegration has intensified real emotions of anger and rage, and 
it led to impact upon the goals and tactics of subsequent collective protest.

terms of network size, Facebook could have played a significant role as a forum of 
information diffusion among the Greek public in a broader range. Subsequently, the 
mobilisation of these protests escalated over the time.
66)
 Twitter network results 
restrictively showed that the media possibly played a significant role in the 
information diffusion process. YouTube results showed that the most popular video 
reflected the Greek public’s anger and rages against the government’s austerity 
policy. Some studies indicate that the use of social media plays a vital role in 
spreading political protest around the world including Athens.
67)
 However, the most 
recent survey in 2015 shows that social media has a limited role in terms of causing 
actual protests.
68)
 The protesters employed social media to organize the events, but 
the impacts of social media are still doubtful.
69)
 Twitter was turned out to be a less 
significant mobilization tool in Greek anti-austerity protests than Spanish indignant 
citizens’ movements.
70)
 Consequently, social media did not trigger actual protests 
but provided a kind of virtual support for the anti-austerity movement.
71)
 
Considering our Facebook and YouTube data, the size of the network and the 
most outstanding vertex in the network could barely reflect the sentiment of a 
social movement. In the context of anti-austerity movements, social media played 
fairly limited roles in terms of causing actual protests. Considering all three roles of 
the social networks, social media at least diffuse negative emotions and spread

pessimistic sentiment among the general public. In order to support this claim, it is 
essential to compare the results of the relevant public opinion survey. The 
percentage of Greek citizens’ support to European integration has been dropped 
significantly over the last ten years (55 in 2007; 38 in 2011; and 31 in 2016).
72)
 
Hence, even though social media cannot actually mobilise anti-austerity protests, 
social media can at least shape the public’s perceptions regarding the related issues. 
Thus, this can be interpreted as a part of the side-effects of social media.     
 For the second question, this paper considers three social media outlets partially 
have three types of power
—
networking power, network power and networked 
power. For networking power, Twitter and YouTube networks showed some 
outstanding nodes which can exercise their power. However, these nodes are not 
likely related to the headquarter organisation of this movement. Hence, the 
networks show that this movement is somewhat decentralised. For network power, 
Facebook and YouTube networks have this power by the close relationship between 
the individuals and faster information diffusion among the nodes in the networks. 
For the networked power, the Twitter network presented the influence chain among 
the nodes. Media is the leading actor who influences other actors in the network. 
This paper considers these social media would not likely to have their 
network-making power because of their decentralised structures. Overall, the results 
here show what types of roles and power the social media have in the general 
public by looking at the case of Greek anti-austerity
 
movement. Due to the severe 
negative impact coming from the Greek government’s austerity measures, the 
members of the Greek society would have suffered, and they used the social media 
as their agora to share their opinion, and the protests have been continuing up to 
the present. This agora might roughly show the size of social capital and influences. 
However, the results would not be able to explain the connection between activities 
of this virtual agora (social media) and the followers’ actual participation of

anti-austerity protests. At least, the negative sentiment and the size of agora among 
the Greek public are the vital prerequisites of anti-austerity protests. 
However, this study certainly has a limitation regarding drawing out the results 
derived from thick narratives of qualitative studies. Consequently, in future research, 
it would be essential to conduct qualitative studies on the Greek anti-austerity 
protests. The possible themes of thick narratives on Greek anti-austerity protests 
can be summarised into three levels. On the first level of the nation-state, 
decentralised anti-austerity protests can wane the political system of Greece.
73)
 On 
the second level of Eurozone, the spread of Greek anti-austerity protests on other 
Eurozone economies. Other than Greek case, anti-austerity protests are also found 
in other Eurozone members in the Mediterranean region such as Italy and Spain. 
The possible impact can be expected in the country’s political setting, public 
opinion supporting political legitimacy and party system.
74)
 Also, the reproduction 
of protest movements can be regarded as another possible impact. In the last level, 
the EU, Greek austerity-protests could bring a solidarity crisis which can be a rise 
in Euroscepticism in other EU member states. One of the examples can be an 
emerging image of “betrayals of trust” out of Greek newspapers. Specifically, the 
political systems or elites were framed as a corrupted and deceptive entity within 
the society.
75)
 Anti-austerity movements can easily build political leverage. When the 
level of Greek national austerity risks was raised, the social movements will oppose 
to transnational power structure.

On 20 August 2018, in Brussels, European Commission President Jean-Claude 
Juncker announced that “the conclusion of the stability support programme marks 
an important moment for Greece and Europe”.
77)
 Pierre Moscovici, commissioner 
for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs said: “The Greek 
government’s extensive reformation have laid the ground for a sustainable 
recovery”.
78)
 Since the beginning of the Greek financial crisis, this crisis has lasted 
almost a decade. However, Greece still has a significant amount of its national debt 
(176.1% of GDP in 2017).
79)
 Other than its national debt, Greece still has the 
highest unemployment rate in the EU (19% in July 2018).
80)
 Considering Greece’s 
current challenges, another tide of citizens’ protest movement might come again in 
the future. When the government carry out the austerity policies regardless of the 
Greek voters’ rejection, their disappointment to the government regarding its 
democracy will be increased.
81)
 Furthermore, such disappointment of the Greek 
public would lead to power expansion of either far-left or far-right parties.
82)
 It 
implies that the Greek anti-austerity movement can block Greece’s democratic 
consolidation. From this viewpoint, when another tide of anti-austerity movements 
comes, it will bring a significant social change in Greece. Also, this change will not 
only enhance Euroscepticism in other Eurozone economies but also weaken
