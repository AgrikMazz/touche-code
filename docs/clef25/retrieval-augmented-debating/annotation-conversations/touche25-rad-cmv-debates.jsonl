{"id": "touche25-rad-cmv-18bgaur", "claim": "I think the existence of god is unknowable.", "description": "As the title says, I believe the existence of God is unknowable, which makes me an agnostic. I have been looking into the issue of the existence of God and I have noticed either 2 (or 3) types of proving that God exists and these are as follows: \n\nArguments for god's existence that end up being debunked/don't actually prove what they try to prove\nTake for the example the ontological argument, which states that God is the greatest thing we can imagine, I'd not be great for it to not exist, therefore it must exist, which can be refuted by simply replacing God with anything, like a floating island full of riches or a world where everyone lives in harmony, Just because I'd be better for X thing to exist, doesn't mean that it does exist. Or for example the cosmological argument (at least for Aquinas), which states that physical things exist now, which means that something non-physical had to bring them into existence and that something is God. But, this doesn't prove say the Christian God, that non-physical thing could just as easily be the universe, this argument just doesn't prove God.  \n\nArguments for god's existence that rely on unfalsifiable hypotheses (in the vein of say the Invisible Pink Unicorn, or the Flying Spaghetti monster or Russell's Teapot) \n\nAn example of this would be the theological argument, or at least how some like to reply to counter-arguments to it, with this argument saying that nature looks designed, therefore it has to be designed and defenders of God usually say that is because of his omnipotent and he made the world in a way that aligns with his OFNI-benevolency. But why do rabbits have tails that hunters can shoot at them? Why do hurricanes, floods exist? Why do we have blind spots in our eyes and other bodily imperfections, among other things, while some say that this is because we got punished? But if he did indeed have his OFNI properties, we couldn't have done the first ever sin, and why would a very good God create creatures that didn't share this goodness? Also, it is likely that the Adam and Eve story isn't even real and is just myth, Evolution, not creationism is the theory most grounded in scientific evidence. Although, a conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a God that is not within the bounds of space time, that does not care about us just because he is morally gray, he is everywhere and everything, or many other things that just make his existence an unfalsifiable hypothesis that just doesn't satisfy anyone, like heck it just makes the belief in him as legit as believing in the Flying Spaghetti monster.  \n\nOh, faith cannot be argued for or against, you just have to look for it yourself (ideas, the Leap of Faith) \n\nSome, like Kierkegaard say that faith ain't something that should be grounded in reason, it's like a Leap of Faith in Indiana Jones, there is a big deep gap between the two cliffs and he (Jones) can't jump over it, but there is possibility that there is one, a 50/50 one. Keep in mind though, this is possibility. Heck, there is a 50/50 possibility for anything, the probability may as well have been 1% for there to have been a tiny bridge and there may have been an even slimmer chance for him to have made onto it and heck is Indiana Jones really a good example? Heck, the course of his character is determined by a God technically, that being the film's creator, but whatever. The Leap of Faith exemplifies the absurd source for meaning in this cold, meaningless universe that will most definitely not succeed, as Camus said (yes, I do believe in absurdism). The fact is, even if faith is something that does not rely on reason as per ideas, it still doesn't solve the issue of God. If he is beyond our space-time realm, he is everywhere and everything etc., cannot be detectable, sellable, traceable, he doesn't care about us or his creation and whatever other properties we assign to him then there is to be no difference between a God and no God at all and even if we were truly under such God and not under just a universe and not some being, which we don't know then the absurd still exists, but that's a whole other topic.  \nStill, I am willing to have my view changed, whether it would be to fully dismiss God or to somehow bring me back to him, like basically the goal is to fill this hole with unfalsifiable and bring it, the truth to me so that I can have a clear position on this once again.", "simulated_debate": [{"role": "user", "content": "I firmly maintain an agnostic stance, stating that the existence of God is unknowable, which implies that the idea of divine knowledge or a veritable belief falls into subjective nature, not factual nor knowable.", "arguments": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's a contradictory stance, as agnosticism requires a firm belief in the unknowability of God's existence, yet you're making a definitive statement about the nature of that unknowability.", "arguments": [{"id": "9967.599", "topic": "Does science justify atheism?", "tags": ["Philosophy", "Science", "Religion"], "attacks": "If it cannot be determined from a scientific point of view whether or not a god exists, then agnosticism is the correct point of view pertaining to knowledge.

While there is an undercurrent of fear regarding the eventual sentience of AI, the more practical and current concern is how AI will eventually change the job market.\nCompanies are now laying off employees and replacing them with AI, like Google firing 30,000 employees. While some have speculated that AI won't take over the majority of jobs, only improving workflow, I find this thought to be naive.\nAI is not the printer press, the cotton gin, or the automobile. While those innovations did replace certain industries (the automobile made blacksmiths and ferries unnecessary since everyone eventually stopped riding around in horse and buggy), they also created new industries that increased production within the overall job market.\nThis is not what AI does. AI does not simply make one or two industries obsolete; it has the potential to make the majority of human workers in most industries obsolete. It does not have the means to increase production beyond what it takes away from the job market.\nThis isn't simply, \"Oh you lost your job due to innovation? You should find new skills.\" Because beyond labor workers (construction, trade skills, military, etc.), all skills can eventually be done by AI and done better.\nAnd people are skeptical saying, \"Well, it can't write code write now.\" or \"The blogs it writes are terrible.\" or \"Did you see that AI art with the three arms?\" While that may be so, the exponential growth means that AI will eventually be good enough to replace the majority of white collar and creative jobs. It's already good enough to replicate writer and painter styles, sext with humans, and remove the majority of low skill computer jobs, like transcription.\nIt's not simply a new innovation. Furthermore, it will eventually be (and I presume very quickly) an entire restructuring of work. Why should companies pay actual humans that are salable when they can hire however many workers to run the AI and produce whatever the organization needs for exponentially cheaper?\nEventually, and I'm guessing within 15 years, AI will reshape the job market to the point where universal basic income will become a necessity for people to simply get money and survive.\nI'm hopeful that someone can change my view on this because I certainly don't want this to happen. I would like the majority of people to keep their jobs, but I currently don't see a future where one of three things don't happen:\n\nFBI is mandated.\nLaws are passed that require companies to have X of human workers.\nA combination of the two.", "simulated_debate": [{"role": "user", "content": "My take is that AI will replace a substantial majority of human jobs in 15 years, rendering it a moral necessity to introduce a basic guaranteed income that meets individuals' essential needs.", "arguments": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This claim relies on the singularity, which is not a fact, but a hypothesised possibility of a future we might live in.", "arguments": [{"id": "1634.5638", "topic": "Should There be a Universal Basic Income (UBI)?", "tags": ["Economics", "Equality", "Money", "Government", "Politics", "Poverty"], "attacks": "UBI is not necessary to combat the fact that AI will not be able to do any task better than humans, physical and cognitive.
