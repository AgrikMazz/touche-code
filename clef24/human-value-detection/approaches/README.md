# Example Approaches for ValueEval'24
See the following examples for kickstarting your own submission. Each of our approaches is designed for straightforward Dockerization, allowing both for reproducible execution and for running the approach as an HTTP-server. Base you own code on one of these to get the same benefits for your code.
- [Random baseline](random-baseline/). Most simple.
- [Random baseline (notebook)](random-baseline-notebook/). Identical, but as a Jupyter notebook.
- [Bert](bert-baseline/). Illustrates how to use (and train) a huggingface model.
- [Ollama](ollama-baseline/). Illustrates how to use a large language model API.
